videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sitting down on a chair and then standing up,1.0,"The prediction 'Sitting down on a chair and then standing up' includes both sitting down and standing up, which are logical temporal parts of the ground truth action 'sit'. According to the evaluation criteria, such transitional movements related to sitting are considered correct."
videos/session_0002_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bowing,1.0,"The prediction 'Bowing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'bow', representing the same human activity."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on the floor,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying on the floor' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: punching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies rhythmic, expressive body movements typically involving the whole body, while the predicted action 'punching' is a specific aggressive or combative motion focused on the arms. Although both are dynamic, they belong to fundamentally different activity categories with little semantic overlap. Punching is not a typical component or temporal phase of dancing, nor is it a plausible interpretation under the abstract label 'dance'."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jogging,1.0,"The prediction 'Jogging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'jog', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling down and then standing up,1.0,"The prediction 'Falling down and then standing up' includes 'falling down', which directly matches the ground truth action 'falldown'. The additional detail about standing up is a plausible temporal continuation and does not contradict the core action."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Squatting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both legs leaving the ground, while 'squatting' is a static or downward bending motion typically performed without leaving the ground. These actions are biomechanically distinct and not temporally or semantically related. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jumping jacks,1.0,The prediction 'Jumping jacks' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumpingjack'.
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squatting,1.0,"The prediction 'Squatting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'squat', representing the same physical activity."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Bending down,0.8,"A lunge involves bending one knee while lowering the body, which visually includes a significant 'bending down' motion. Although 'bending down' is less specific than 'lunge', it accurately captures a core component of the action and is a plausible interpretation given the low-resolution thermal video context."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turning around (rotating in place),1.0,The prediction 'Turning around (rotating in place)' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'turn'.
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Crawling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise performed in a prone position, while the predicted action 'crawling' involves forward motion on hands and knees or elbows. Although both involve being on the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. Crawling is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a pushup, nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract labeling. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible interpretation under which walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to a legraise."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context differ significantly. 'Waving' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'airdrum', nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract or partial observation constraints."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Throwing an object,0.3,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves specific upper-body striking movements, typically with fists. The prediction 'Throwing an object' describes a different motor pattern—propelling an external item—rather than punching or defensive maneuvers characteristic of boxing. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a low-similarity match."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Looking around while standing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers to a specific head movement, typically side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the head. The prediction 'Looking around while standing' describes a different behavior involving eye or whole-head scanning movements, possibly with torso rotation, but not the deliberate, repetitive shaking motion implied by 'shakehead'. While both involve head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution, making this a low-score mismatch."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: talking on the phone,1.0,"The prediction 'talking on the phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'eat' involves consuming food, while the predicted action 'taking a photo' is a completely unrelated activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where taking a photo would be considered part of eating or vice versa."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'taking a photo' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible interpretation under which taking a photo constitutes wiping one's face or a related sub-action."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Picking up an object from the floor,1.0,The prediction 'Picking up an object from the floor' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'pickup'.
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' inherently involves repetitive jumping. The prediction 'jumping' captures the core motion of the activity, even if it omits the specific use of a rope. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on action similarity rather than exact object usage, this is a highly accurate and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are distinct but highly similar cleaning actions that involve comparable body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). Given the low-resolution thermal video input, the VLM may not distinguish between the specific tool used (mop vs. broom), and both actions fall under the same functional category of floor cleaning. This constitutes a strong semantic and functional match, warranting a high score."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person actively grooming their hair, typically with a brush or hand near the head. The predicted action 'talking on the phone' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap—phone use does not constitute a phase or variant of hair brushing, nor are they contextually related in this scenario."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Waving' involves arm movement but is a distinct social gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a mobile phone (texting/typing),1.0,"The predicted action 'Using a mobile phone (texting/typing)' is a precise and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'playphone', which commonly refers to interacting with a mobile phone through activities like texting, browsing, or typing."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The prediction 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or plausible variants under the given constraints."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: Typing on a laptop while seated,1.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing, and the prediction 'Typing on a laptop while seated' is a specific and accurate description of that action. The added context of 'while seated' does not contradict the core activity and is consistent with typical typing behavior."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Giving a thumbs-up gesture,1.0,The prediction 'Giving a thumbs-up gesture' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'thumbup'.
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing with one arm outstretched,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is pointed downward. The predicted action 'Pointing with one arm outstretched' describes a different gesture, likely involving an extended finger or arm, which is not semantically equivalent or a temporal part of 'thumbdown'. While both involve hand/arm movements, they convey distinct meanings and gestures, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Showing “two” with fingers (V-sign hand gesture),0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers specifically to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle), while the predicted action describes a 'V-sign' (showing two fingers), which is a distinctly different hand gesture. Although both involve hand signals, they are semantically and visually dissimilar, constituting a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Showing a peace/victory sign (two-finger gesture),1.0,"The predicted action 'Showing a peace/victory sign (two-finger gesture)' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both describe the same specific hand gesture."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Raising hand,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'Raising hand' describes a generic upward movement that does not capture the circular trajectory or directional specificity of the true action. These actions are fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely with precision and directionality. The prediction 'Raising arm' describes a generic upward movement that does not capture the circular or directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action lacks the essential characteristics of the ground truth and is too dissimilar to be considered a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'Waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no indication that waving is a temporal part of presenting a stop sign, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a specific action where a person pulls their hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled motion. 'Waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a greeting or signaling motion, which is directionally and functionally different. While both involve hand movement, they are not semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of the same action."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving (hand wave),0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a friendly or communicative gesture. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion dynamics differ significantly, making this a related but incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving hand,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving hand' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', describing the same specific gesture with only minor phrasing differences."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: punching,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'punching' is a forceful, forward-directed striking motion. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and context, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, movement-based activity (e.g., sliding down a slide or performing a sliding motion), whereas the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture with no motion. This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score category per the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or creating a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and movement patterns, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Leaning backward while standing,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dodge' typically involves a quick evasive movement, such as leaning or shifting the body to avoid something. The prediction 'Leaning backward while standing' is a plausible and specific instance of a dodging motion, especially in a constrained thermal video where full context may be limited. This aligns well with the intent and physical manifestation of 'dodge'."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up an object from the floor,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including holding and swinging a ball toward pins, typically with a forward lunge or step. 'Picking up an object from the floor' is not a typical or necessary part of bowling and does not align semantically or temporally with the core action. While both involve bending or reaching, the context and intent differ significantly, making this a weak match at best."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Raising one arm up (hand up / pointing upward),1.0,"The predicted action 'Raising one arm up (hand up / pointing upward)' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'liftupahand'. Both describe the same specific movement of elevating one hand/arm, indicating an exact match in meaning."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Saluting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand), while the predicted action 'saluting' is a distinct, structured gesture involving raising the hand to the forehead. These actions differ significantly in form, intent, and motion pattern. Although both involve hand movement, saluting is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of tapping, nor is it a plausible interpretation under the constraints of the task."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, pointing is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of drawing a triangle, nor is it a plausible component of that specific action. Thus, the prediction is only loosely related at best, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: sneezing,1.0,"The prediction 'sneezing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'sneeze', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."

videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical nuance of instability inherent to 'stagger'. This is not a temporal part nor a semantic equivalent, but a related yet significantly different action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or categorical overlap between them."
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video due to head/upper body motion, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and mechanics. Blowing one's nose typically involves holding a tissue and deliberate nasal clearing, whereas coughing is a reflexive throat/chest action. The VLM's prediction is related but not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or valid instance of 'blownose', warranting a low score."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Raising both arms overhead,0.9,"The predicted action 'Raising both arms overhead' is a specific and common movement that falls under the general category of 'stretchoneself'. Stretching often involves raising the arms overhead to stretch the torso, shoulders, or back, making this prediction semantically consistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Talking on the phone,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or face but not necessarily touching the face itself. Although there may be superficial visual similarity in thermal imagery (e.g., hand near head), the actions are semantically distinct and do not represent temporal parts or equivalents of each other."
videos/session_0056_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshaking,1.0,"The prediction 'Handshaking' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handshake', representing the same specific social interaction."
videos/session_0057_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Punching another person,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' involves forceful physical contact directed at another person. The prediction 'Punching another person' is a different specific aggressive action, but it shares strong semantic and contextual overlap—both involve intentional, forceful interaction with another individual in a confrontational manner. While not identical, punching can be considered a plausible misinterpretation of pushing in low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details are ambiguous. Thus, it warrants a high score due to close action similarity."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking the other person,1.0,"The predicted action 'Kicking the other person' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth 'kicksomeone', describing the same aggressive physical interaction with another person."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: talking / having a conversation,0.0,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' is a specific, dynamic, and aggressive physical interaction, while the predicted action 'talking / having a conversation' describes a completely different, non-physical, and socially cooperative activity. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."

videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on the floor,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, often on a surface such as a bed or floor. The prediction 'Lying on the floor' is a semantically appropriate and plausible description of a person engaged in sleeping, especially given the constraints of a low-resolution thermal video where bedding may not be distinguishable. Thus, the predicted action aligns well with the expected posture and behavior for 'sleep'."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jumping jack,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Jumping jack' is a specific, active movement that could reasonably occur as part of freestyle dancing or general dance-like activity, especially in a thermal video where fine motion details may be ambiguous. Therefore, the prediction is a valid instance of the broader 'dance' category."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jogging in place,1.0,"The prediction 'Jogging in place' is a specific and valid instance of the ground truth action 'jog', as it represents a form of jogging that aligns semantically and temporally with the label."
videos/session_0068_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Lying down on the ground,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' implies a person ending up on the ground, likely in a lying or prone position. The prediction 'Lying down on the ground' accurately describes the end state of a fall and is a semantically valid representation of the action, especially given the temporal partiality allowed in the task."

videos/session_0070_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Waving arms,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a specific, dynamic full-body exercise involving coordinated arm and leg movements. The prediction 'waving arms' captures only a partial and non-characteristic aspect of the motion—arm movement—but misses the essential leg motion and rhythmic jumping that define jumping jacks. While there is some overlap in arm motion, 'waving arms' is too generic and does not reflect the structured, repetitive nature of jumping jacks, placing it in the low-score range."
videos/session_0071_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squatting,1.0,"The prediction 'Squatting' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'squat', representing the same physical activity."

videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Picking up an object from the ground,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving rhythmic lowering and raising of the body. The predicted action 'picking up an object from the ground' describes a different motion pattern—typically involving bending or squatting—and does not correspond to any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a pushup. The actions are functionally and kinematically distinct."
videos/session_0075_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'Walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible interpretation under which walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to a legraise."
videos/session_0076_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm movements. 'Clapping' is a different rhythmic hand action but does not resemble drumming in motion pattern or intent. While both involve upper-body movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0077_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: boxing,1.0,"The predicted action 'boxing' exactly matches the ground truth action 'boxing', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0078_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: standing still,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'standing still' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, and the prediction fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of the ground truth."
videos/session_0079_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Talking on the phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Talking on the phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."
videos/session_0080_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking from a container,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they are distinct actions with different semantic meanings. The ground truth 'eat' specifically refers to consuming solid food, whereas the prediction 'drinking from a container' refers to consuming liquid. This is not a temporal phase of eating nor a semantic equivalent, placing it in the low-to-mid overlap range. Given the clear distinction between eating and drinking in human activity recognition, the match is insufficient for a medium or high score."
videos/session_0081_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The prediction 'drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0082_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Drinking from a cup/bottle,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is distinctly different from 'drinking from a cup/bottle'. These actions involve different objects, body movements, and intentions, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0083_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Bending down,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending down' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking up an object typically involves bending down to reach it. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action sequence."
videos/session_0084_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves a dynamic, rhythmic jumping motion with arm movement simulating rope turning. The prediction 'waving' describes a static or slow arm gesture unrelated to the core motion of jumping rope. While both involve arm movement, the actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0085_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Picking up an object from the floor,0.3,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a repetitive, sweeping motion with a mop, typically while standing and moving across the floor. The predicted action 'picking up an object from the floor' describes a distinct, momentary bending or squatting motion that is not a typical component of mopping. While both involve interaction with the floor, they are semantically different actions with different intent and motion patterns. Thus, the prediction is only loosely related and does not qualify as a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0086_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (like a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion often due to itch. The VLM's prediction does not capture the core semantics or typical execution of 'brushhair', making it a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0087_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the arm and finger in a direction, which is functionally and kinematically distinct from a bicep curl. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."

videos/session_0089_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both may involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are not temporally related phases nor interchangeable under abstract labels. Thus, this is a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0090_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially since 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0091_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Waving hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' is a specific hand gesture involving raising the thumb, while the predicted action 'waving hand' describes a different hand motion typically involving side-to-side movement of the whole hand. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and motions, making this a partial but insufficient match. Hence, it falls into the low-score range."
videos/session_0092_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Waving' describes a different hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These are distinct gestures with different meanings and motion patterns, making them semantically unrelated in this context."
videos/session_0093_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Waving (hand wave),0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle), which is a specific static hand pose. The predicted action 'Waving (hand wave)' involves a different, dynamic hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are visually and semantically distinct; waving does not represent a temporal phase or variant of making the 'OK' sign, nor are they functionally or gesturally equivalent."
videos/session_0094_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the hand with index and middle fingers extended in a V shape). The prediction 'Waving' describes a different hand motion involving side-to-side or up-and-down movement of the hand, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of making a victory sign. While both involve hand gestures, they are distinct actions with different intent and form, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0095_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion, likely in front of the body. 'Waving hand' is a different gesture involving back-and-forth or up-and-down motion, not a circular trajectory. While both involve hand movement, the motion patterns are distinct and not temporally or semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0096_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Punching,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a controlled, circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction, likely fine motor movement. The predicted action 'Punching' involves a rapid, linear, forceful motion, which is fundamentally different in both trajectory and intent. There is no semantic, temporal, or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0097_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving hand,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'Waving hand' describes a distinctly different gesture that does not correspond to displaying or holding a stop sign. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between waving and presenting a stop sign, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0098_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: hand waving,0.3,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a deliberate inward pulling motion of the hand (e.g., toward the body), while the prediction 'hand waving' describes a lateral or oscillatory motion typically used for greeting. These are distinct actions with different movement patterns and intent. Although both involve hand motion, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, or specific instances of a broader shared category. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated (hence above 0.0)."
videos/session_0099_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing forward with one arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or defensive motion of pushing someone's hand away, which involves contact or close interaction. The prediction 'Pointing forward with one arm' describes a distinct gesture that lacks the pushing motion or defensive intent. While both involve arm movement, the actions are semantically and functionally different, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving hand,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving hand' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', describing the same activity with slightly different phrasing."
videos/session_0101_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement."
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Waving,0.3,"While both 'clap' and 'waving' involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. Clapping involves striking the hands together repeatedly, whereas waving is a side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand, typically for greeting or signaling. The prediction does not represent a temporal part, synonym, or valid instance of 'clap', nor is 'clap' an abstract category that includes waving. Therefore, the match is incorrect but not entirely unrelated, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'Pointing' is a static, upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding. The two actions are fundamentally different in nature and intent."
videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve the repetitive, angular motion characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand use, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Falling backward,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive lateral or directional movement to avoid something. 'Falling backward' is a fundamentally different motion—passive, uncontrolled, and not evasive in the same intentional manner. While both involve body displacement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no clear temporal or logical overlap."
videos/session_0106_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up an object,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including holding and swinging a bowling ball toward pins. 'Picking up an object' is only a minor, non-diagnostic component that could occur in many contexts and does not capture the essence or typical motion pattern of bowling. While it may be a partial step, it lacks the specificity and semantic alignment required for a higher score."
videos/session_0107_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving hand,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' describes raising a hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving hand'. Waving typically involves lifting the hand as a core component, making this a highly plausible and contextually appropriate interpretation of the action in a thermal video where fine motion details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0108_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Hand waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand), while the predicted action 'hand waving' describes a broader, repetitive motion typically used for greeting or signaling. Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Hand waving is not a temporal part nor a plausible variant of tapping, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0109_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific fine motor hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together. The prediction 'Hand waving' describes a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand typically used for greeting or signaling, which is functionally and kinematically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. While both involve hand motion, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or instances of the same abstract category. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0110_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing with one arm,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific gesture or motion likely involving tracing a triangular shape, possibly with the hand or arm. The prediction 'Pointing with one arm' is a different, more generic gesture that does not clearly constitute drawing a triangle. While both involve arm movement, pointing lacks the distinctive spatial pattern (i.e., forming a triangle) required by the ground truth, making it only loosely related at best."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Sneezing,1.0,"The prediction 'Sneezing' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sneeze', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0112_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Talking on the phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' involves a completely different behavior with no semantic or temporal overlap. Coughing does not logically include or resemble phone usage, and vice versa."
videos/session_0113_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Side bending / stretching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often due to imbalance or impairment. The predicted action 'side bending / stretching' describes a controlled, deliberate static or dynamic stretch, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from staggering. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0114_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouthed inhalation often associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different and unrelated behavior. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between yawning and drinking in this context."
videos/session_0115_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, typically with an arm raised to the face. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a completely different activity with distinct motion patterns and body posture. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0116_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Waving arms,0.6,"Waving arms can be a form of stretching, especially in a thermal video where fine details are unclear. While not an exact match, it is a plausible and related upper-body movement that could fall under the broader interpretation of 'stretchoneself', particularly if the person is performing dynamic arm motions to stretch. However, 'waving' typically implies a social gesture rather than self-stretching, making the match only partially accurate."
videos/session_0117_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Talking on the phone,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'Talking on the phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or mouth but not necessarily touching the face in the same manner. Although there may be slight overlap (e.g., phone use might involve some facial proximity), the actions are semantically distinct and do not represent the same behavior or its temporal phases. Therefore, this is considered a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0118_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshaking,1.0,"The prediction 'Handshaking' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handshake', representing the same specific social interaction."
videos/session_0119_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."

videos/session_0122_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: handshaking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion directed at another person, while the predicted action 'handshaking' describes a friendly, consensual social gesture. These actions are semantically and physically distinct in intent, motion, and context, with no temporal or categorical overlap. Thus, the prediction is nearly opposite in meaning and warrants a very low score."
videos/session_0123_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: talking,1.0,"The prediction 'talking' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'conversation', as conversation inherently involves talking between individuals."

videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on the floor,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying on the floor' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action of sleeping in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Raising both arms above the head,0.9,"The predicted action 'Raising both arms above the head' is a plausible and specific movement that can reasonably be part of dancing, especially in freestyle or expressive dance contexts. Since 'dance' is an abstract label encompassing a wide range of movements, this prediction aligns well with the ground truth."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Turning around,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jog' implies continuous, rhythmic forward motion, typically involving running at a slow pace. The predicted action 'Turning around' describes a brief, rotational movement that is not a typical temporal component of jogging and does not align semantically or dynamically with the sustained locomotion implied by 'jog'. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0130_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling down,1.0,"The prediction 'Falling down' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'falldown', differing only in phrasing and capitalization."

videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a dynamic, full-body exercise involving repeated jumping and arm movements. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture with no motion, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the energetic and repetitive nature of jumping jacks. This falls under the low-score category as it misrepresents a clearly dynamic action as static."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: standing still,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a dynamic, lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically with movement. The prediction 'standing still' describes a static, inactive posture that does not correspond to any temporal phase of squatting (e.g., lowering down or standing up from a squat). This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score criteria."
videos/session_0134_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: kneeling down,0.6,"A lunge involves stepping forward with one leg while lowering the hips, often resulting in one knee nearing the ground—but the person remains upright and typically doesn't fully kneel. 'Kneeling down' suggests both knees contacting the ground and a more static, lowered posture, which is related but not a precise match or direct temporal phase of a lunge. However, due to visual ambiguity in low-resolution thermal video, the actions may appear similar, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0135_turn.mp4,turn,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a dynamic rotational movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture with no indication of turning. This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score criteria."

videos/session_0137_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with legraise. There is no plausible scenario where walking would be considered a valid part or equivalent of a legraise."
videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements near a drum kit or in the air. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different arm motion—usually a side-to-side or up-and-down gesture for greeting or signaling—which lacks the specific rhythmic and percussive nature of airdrumming. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns, making this a low-similarity match."
videos/session_0139_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punching (shadow boxing),1.0,The prediction 'Punching (shadow boxing)' is a specific and accurate instance of the ground truth action 'boxing'. Shadow boxing is a core component of boxing training and directly aligns with the labeled activity.
videos/session_0140_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing still,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a dynamic, specific movement involving head motion, while the prediction 'Standing still' describes a static posture with no indication of head movement. This is a completely different action and fails to capture any aspect of the labeled behavior."
videos/session_0141_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0142_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Taking a photo (using a camera),0.0,"The ground truth action 'eat' involves consuming food, while the predicted action 'taking a photo' is entirely unrelated in both semantics and physical motion. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions."

videos/session_0144_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'taking a photo' implies holding a device and capturing an image, which is visually and semantically unrelated to wiping one's face. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions, and the prediction constitutes a completely different activity."
videos/session_0145_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Bending down,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending down' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking something up typically involves bending down to reach the object. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action, warranting a high score."
videos/session_0146_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping in place,0.9,"Jumping in place is a highly plausible and semantically close representation of 'jumprope', especially in low-resolution thermal video where rope details may be invisible. The core motion—repetitive vertical jumping—matches the essential characteristic of jump roping, making this a near-equivalent prediction."
videos/session_0147_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are distinct but highly similar cleaning actions that involve comparable motions (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive manner). In low-resolution thermal video, these actions can appear visually similar, and both fall under the same high-level semantic category of floor cleaning. Given the context and the instruction to consider action similarity over exact wording, this prediction is semantically close enough to warrant a high score."
videos/session_0148_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Saluting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to brush or comb their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'Saluting' is a distinct gesture involving a rigid hand motion to the forehead, commonly associated with military protocol. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and context. There is no temporal or semantic overlap that would justify considering saluting as part of brushing hair, nor are they related under any abstract category. Thus, the prediction is nearly completely incorrect."
videos/session_0149_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving arm movement, while the predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely unrelated activity with different motion patterns and intent.

videos/session_0151_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The prediction 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is semantically and behaviorally distinct. While both involve the mouth area, they are functionally unrelated actions with different motion patterns and intents, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0152_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting on a chair,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements typically while seated. The predicted action 'Sitting on a chair' describes only the posture and omits the essential typing activity. Since 'sitting' is a generic static description that fails to capture the core dynamic action implied by 'type', it is considered incorrect."
videos/session_0153_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is raised, typically as a signal of approval. The predicted action 'Pointing' involves extending the index finger to indicate direction or object, which is a distinctly different hand gesture. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, and pointing is not a temporal phase or variant of giving a thumbs-up."
videos/session_0154_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form.

The prediction 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture involving an extended finger, which is semantically distinct and not a temporal or contextual part of making the 'OK' sign. Therefore, the actions are largely dissimilar."

videos/session_0158_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically side-to-side or up-and-down repetitive hand motion that does not match the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a counterclockwise circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0159_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person mimicking or holding a stop sign gesture (typically an arm extended with an open palm), which is a specific static pose.

videos/session_0165_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, movement-based activity (e.g., sliding down a slide or performing a sliding motion), whereas the prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture with no motion. This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score category per the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0166_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Standing still,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a dynamic, deliberate hand or body motion to create a zigzag pattern, likely involving movement. The prediction 'Standing still' describes a static posture with no motion, which is inconsistent with the dynamic nature of 'drawzigzag'. This constitutes a completely different action and falls under the low-score category."
videos/session_0167_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Falling down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement to avoid something, typically involving lateral or sudden shifts in posture while remaining upright and alert. The prediction 'Falling down' describes a loss of balance or collapse, which is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of dodging. While both involve motion, they are functionally and kinematically distinct—falling is uncontrolled, whereas dodging is intentional and agile. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0168_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Bowing,0.2,"The predicted action 'Bowing' is a completely different activity from the ground truth 'bowling'. While the words sound similar, they refer to distinct actions: 'bowling' involves rolling a ball toward pins, whereas 'bowing' is a gesture of respect or greeting. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two in the context of human activity recognition."
videos/session_0169_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it.

The predicted action 'Pointing with one arm extended' describes a gross motor movement involving the whole arm and is semantically unrelated to the precise hand motion implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no temporal or functional overlap between pointing and the spread-and-pinch gesture, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0172_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'Waving hand' is a generic, rhythmic motion that does not correspond to the structured, geometric motion required for drawing a triangle. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no significant overlap in intent or form."
videos/session_0173_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.6,"Coughing and sneezing are both upper-respiratory reflexive actions that may appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of sudden head and torso movements. While not identical, they are semantically related and could be confused under limited visual information. However, they are distinct physiological actions, so the match is partial but not exact."
videos/session_0174_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Bowing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory reflex, while the predicted action 'bowing' involves a deliberate forward bending of the torso. These actions are anatomically and semantically unrelated, with no temporal or contextual overlap in this context."
videos/session_0175_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, which is dynamic and distinct from simply 'standing'. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture and does not capture the instability or motion inherent in staggering. This constitutes a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0176_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouth inhalation typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different and unrelated behavior.

This is a semantically valid instance of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0179_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their own face, which is distinct from 'smoking'. While both may involve hand-to-face motion, smoking implies holding and inhaling from a cigarette or similar object, which is not equivalent to or a temporal part of touching one's face. The actions are semantically different and not interchangeable in this context."

videos/session_0189_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on the floor,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, often on a surface such as a bed or floor. The prediction 'Lying on the floor' is a semantically appropriate and plausible posture for sleeping, especially in a thermal video context where fine details (like closed eyes or bedding) may not be visible. While not an exact verbal match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with sleeping."
videos/session_0190_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Waving hands,0.6,"Waving hands is a form of expressive upper-body movement that can be considered a simple or partial form of dancing, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. While not a full representation of 'dance', it is plausibly related and falls under a broad interpretation of rhythmic or expressive motion. However, it lacks the full-body or rhythmic complexity typically associated with dancing, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more dynamic gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0192_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Lying down on the floor and then getting back up,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' typically involves a person falling to the floor, which often ends with them lying down. The prediction 'Lying down on the floor and then getting back up' includes the key outcome of a fall (lying on the floor) and adds a recovery phase. While 'falldown' emphasizes the act of falling rather than the recovery, the described state of being on the floor is a direct and expected consequence of a fall, making this a semantically appropriate and temporally related interpretation."
videos/session_0193_jump.mp4,jump,Action: crouching down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving leaving the ground, while the predicted action 'crouching down' is a static or preparatory lowering motion that does not constitute jumping. Although crouching might precede a jump, it is not a sufficient or representative part of the jumping action itself, especially without evidence of the actual jump in the prediction. Thus, the actions are semantically distinct and mismatched."

videos/session_0197_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not inherently involve turning, nor is it a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0198_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Crawling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise performed in a prone position, while the predicted action 'crawling' involves forward motion on hands and knees or elbows. Although both involve being low to the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. There is no significant semantic overlap or temporal relationship that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0199_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'Walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises.

The predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of motions (e.g., bringing a container to the mouth) and is unrelated both semantically and kinematically. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0201_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, repetitive punching movements typically performed in a fighting stance. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a static or minimally dynamic gesture that is semantically unrelated to boxing. It does not represent a temporal phase of boxing, nor is it a plausible component or abstraction of the activity. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0202_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing still,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a dynamic, specific head movement, while the prediction 'Standing still' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion.

videos/session_0208_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Waving hands,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves a dynamic, full-body motion centered around jumping with a rope. The predicted action 'Waving hands' is a completely different upper-body gesture that does not correspond to any plausible phase or component of jump roping. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Vacuuming the floor,0.85,"Both 'mopping the floor' and 'vacuuming the floor' involve similar postures, movements (e.g., pushing/pulling a cleaning tool across the floor), and intent (cleaning). While not identical, they are semantically close within the domain of floor-cleaning activities, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained tool distinction may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Hands on head,0.6,"The predicted action 'Hands on head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand contact with the head, but it lacks specificity. Brushing hair implies a repetitive or grooming motion, whereas 'Hands on head' could describe a static pose or unrelated gesture. This is a plausible but ambiguous interaction, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0211_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Pointing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow to lift a weight.

videos/session_0213_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0214_type.mp4,type,Action: Using a smartphone (texting) while seated,0.2,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing, likely on a keyboard or similar device. The prediction 'Using a smartphone (texting) while seated' describes a different activity—texting on a phone—which is not semantically equivalent to typing in this context. While both involve finger movements and seated posture, they represent distinct human-computer interactions. Given the specificity of the label 'type', the prediction is considered a different action, warranting a low score."

'Walking' is a slow, steady, and non-evasive gait that does not align with the dynamic and reactive nature of dodging. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0230_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Bending down,0.6,"Bending down is a plausible component of the bowling action (e.g., during the approach or follow-through), but it is not specific enough to fully capture the distinct motion of bowling, which involves arm swinging and ball release. Thus, it is related but less specific."

videos/session_0273_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving lifting a weight toward the shoulder. The predicted action 'drinking' involves bringing a container to the mouth and is functionally and kinematically unrelated. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0274_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Walking while using a phone,0.9,"The ground truth action 'playphone' implies using a phone, and the prediction 'Walking while using a phone' includes this core element. Although it adds walking, which isn't specified in the label, using a phone is the primary activity, and performing it while walking is a plausible and common real-world variation. Thus, the prediction captures the essential action and deserves a high score."
videos/session_0275_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The prediction 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are functionally and contextually different actions with minimal overlap in intent or execution. Therefore, this is considered a nearly complete mismatch."
videos/session_0276_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which involves fine hand/finger movements and is typically performed while seated. The predicted action 'Sitting' describes a static posture but does not capture the essential typing behavior. Since 'sitting' is a generic static state and omits the core action of typing, it is considered a completely different activity in this context."

videos/session_0281_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular movement and is semantically distinct. While both may involve arm motion, pointing is not a temporal phase or equivalent of drawing a circle, nor is it a plausible component of the intended action."
videos/session_0282_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving (hand gesture),0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'waving (hand gesture)' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down hand movement that lacks the circular and directional specificity of the true action. While both involve hand gestures, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0283_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving hand,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'waving hand' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap.

videos/session_0284_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. These actions are semantically unrelated and involve distinct motion patterns and intent, with no temporal or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0285_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension to indicate direction or object, lacking the pushing or repelling component. While both involve arm/hand movement, they serve different intents and kinematics, making them semantically dissimilar. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0291_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: staggering,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position to avoid something. 'Staggering' suggests an unsteady or stumbling motion, which may share some visual similarity (e.g., sudden lateral movement) but lacks the intentional, agile nature of dodging. While not completely unrelated, it is a less specific and somewhat inaccurate interpretation of the intended action."
videos/session_0292_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up an object from the floor,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including holding and swinging a ball toward pins, typically with a forward lunge or step. 'Picking up an object from the floor' is not a typical or necessary part of bowling and does not align semantically or temporally with the core action. While both involve bending or reaching, the context and intent differ significantly, making this a weak match at best."
videos/session_0293_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Pointing,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'Pointing', as pointing typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger.

The predicted action 'Pointing with outstretched arm' describes a gross motor movement focused on arm extension and pointing, which is functionally and kinematically distinct from the precise hand motion implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is minimal semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0296_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'Hand waving' is a generic, rhythmic motion that does not correspond to the structured, geometric motion required to draw a triangle. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0297_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.6,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, reflexive respiratory actions that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of upper body motion and head movement. While not the same action, they are closely related and may be difficult to distinguish under the given input constraints. However, they are distinct physiological events, so an exact or temporal-part match does not apply, warranting a medium score."

videos/session_0306_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Punching,0.6,"While 'punching' and 'pushsomeone' are both aggressive or forceful interpersonal actions, they are distinct in intent and motion: punching involves a striking motion with a closed fist, whereas pushing typically uses open hands to exert force. However, in low-resolution thermal video, these actions may appear visually similar, and both involve direct physical contact. Thus, the prediction is related but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0307_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: talking with another person,0.0,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a dynamic, aggressive physical interaction involving a kicking motion. The predicted action 'talking with another person' describes a completely different, non-physical, and static social interaction. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, and the prediction fails to capture any aspect of the actual activity."

videos/session_0313_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and 'lying down' is a core and necessary component of sleeping. While not all instances of lying down result in sleep, in the context of HAR with abstract or high-level labels, this prediction accurately captures the essential posture associated with the labeled activity."
videos/session_0314_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Running,0.0,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies rhythmic, expressive body movements, typically involving the whole body in a coordinated and often dynamic manner. The predicted action 'Running' is a completely different physical activity focused on locomotion and lacks the characteristic features of dancing. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between running and dancing in this context, making the prediction incorrect."
videos/session_0315_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Running,1.0,"The predicted action 'Running' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'jog', as both describe similar forms of fast, rhythmic locomotion. In common usage and HAR contexts, 'jog' and 'run' are often used interchangeably or represent points on the same activity spectrum."
videos/session_0316_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: lying down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'falldown' typically ends with a person lying on the ground. The prediction 'lying down' accurately describes the end state of a fall and is a logical temporal consequence of the 'falldown' action, making it semantically aligned despite not capturing the dynamic falling motion itself."

videos/session_0319_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Bending down and standing up,0.9,"The prediction 'Bending down and standing up' accurately describes the motion involved in performing a squat, which entails lowering the body (bending down) and returning to a standing position. This is a semantically equivalent and temporally appropriate description of the ground truth action 'squat'."
videos/session_0320_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Kneeling down,0.6,"A lunge involves stepping forward with one leg while lowering the hips, often resulting in one knee near the ground—but it is distinct from 'kneeling down,' which typically implies both knees contacting the ground and a static or devotional posture. While both involve lowering the body and bending knees, 'kneeling down' is not a standard temporal phase of a lunge. However, due to partial visual similarity in thermal video (e.g., bent legs, lowered torso), the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0321_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turning around while standing,1.0,"The prediction 'Turning around while standing' directly describes the ground truth action 'turn'. It captures the core motion (rotation of the body) and provides additional valid context (while standing), which is consistent with the expected behavior for this label."

videos/session_0323_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching in place,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching in place' involves alternating leg lifts while standing and is a different type of movement with distinct biomechanics and intent. Although both involve leg motion, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor is marching a valid instantiation of 'legraise'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0324_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both hands moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving hand' describes a different, simpler gesture that lacks the characteristic motion pattern of air-drumming. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."

The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same broader category. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0341_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which is a specific static hand configuration. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a different, dynamic hand motion that does not correspond to making the 'OK' sign.

While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are absent. Thus, it qualifies as a semantically equivalent and temporally plausible representation of the action."
videos/session_0352_dance.mp4,dance,Action: kicking,0.6,"Kicking can be a component of certain dance styles (e.g., kick-based moves in freestyle or energetic dancing), making it plausibly related to 'dance'. However, 'kicking' alone is not strongly indicative of dancing and could belong to other activities like martial arts or soccer. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but less specific or ambiguous match."
videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0354_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Lying down on the ground and then standing back up,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' typically involves a person falling to the ground, which often ends with them lying down. The prediction 'Lying down on the ground and then standing back up' includes the key component of being on the ground (consistent with having fallen) and adds standing back up, which is a plausible continuation or recovery phase. While not an exact match, it captures the essential outcome of a fall and aligns semantically with the expected visual content of a 'falldown' event."
videos/session_0355_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Squatting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both feet leaving the ground, while 'squatting' is a static or downward bending motion typically performed with feet remaining on the ground. These actions are biomechanically distinct and not temporally or semantically related. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0356_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping jack,1.0,"The prediction 'jumping jack' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumpingjack', differing only in formatting (space vs. no space). This is a correct and precise identification of the activity."

videos/session_0358_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, which is distinct from 'walking'. Although both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static, exertive nature of a lunge and instead describes a different, unrelated locomotive activity."
videos/session_0359_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turn around,1.0,"The prediction 'turn around' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'turn', as both describe the same core rotational movement."
videos/session_0360_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Crawling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise performed in a prone position, while the predicted action 'crawling' involves forward motion on hands and knees or belly. Although both involve being low to the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. Crawling is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of doing a pushup, nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract labeling. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0361_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Kicking,0.6,"While 'kicking' is not the same as 'legraise', both involve active leg movement and occur in similar contexts (e.g., exercise or core workouts). However, 'kicking' typically implies dynamic motion with momentum, whereas 'legraise' is a controlled, static-to-dynamic lift while lying down. The actions are related but not equivalent or temporal parts of each other, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0362_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of motions (e.g., holding a container, bringing it to the mouth) and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."

videos/session_0368_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: drinking from a cup/bottle,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is distinctly different from 'drinking from a cup/bottle', an action involving holding a container and consuming liquid. These actions involve different hand trajectories, object interactions, and facial contact patterns, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0369_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down or reaching to lift an object, while 'bowing' is a distinct social or ceremonial gesture that may visually resemble bending but lacks the object-interaction intent central to 'pickup'. Although both involve forward torso movement, they are semantically different actions with different purposes, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0370_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves repetitive jumping, and the predicted action 'Jumping' captures the core dynamic movement of the activity. While not an exact label match, it is a semantically valid and specific representation of the primary motion in jumprope, especially given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video."
videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are distinct but highly similar cleaning actions involving comparable body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). Given the low-resolution thermal video input, the VLM may not distinguish between a mop and a broom, and both actions fall under the same functional category of floor cleaning. This constitutes a strong semantic match, warranting a high score."
videos/session_0372_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Putting on a hat,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming the hair, typically with a brush or hand, while the predicted action 'Putting on a hat' is a distinct activity that does not overlap semantically or temporally with brushing hair. Although both involve the head region, the intent and motion are fundamentally different, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0373_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repetitive arm flexion, typically with weights. The predicted action 'Drinking' involves bringing a container to the mouth and is functionally and kinematically unrelated to a bicep curl. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."

videos/session_0375_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0376_type.mp4,type,Action: Reading while sitting on a chair,0.2,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves specific hand/finger movements. The prediction 'Reading while sitting on a chair' describes a completely different activity that does not involve typing. Although both may occur in a seated position, the core actions are unrelated, making this a mismatch."

videos/session_0378_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Thumbs up / thumbs down gesture,1.0,"The predicted action 'Thumbs up / thumbs down gesture' explicitly includes 'thumbs down', which directly matches the ground truth action 'thumbdown'. The phrasing accounts for possible ambiguity in gesture direction but correctly identifies the relevant action category."
videos/session_0379_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle), which is a specific static hand pose. The predicted action 'Pointing' involves extending the index finger to indicate direction or object, which is a different hand gesture with distinct finger configuration and intent. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and visually distinct actions with no significant overlap in form or purpose."
videos/session_0380_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the hand with index and middle fingers extended in a V-shape). The prediction 'Waving' describes a different hand motion involving repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down movement. While both involve hand gestures, they are semantically and visually distinct actions with different intents, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0381_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving (raising one arm),0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction, likely performed deliberately and repeatedly. The predicted action 'Waving (raising one arm)' describes a different, non-circular motion typically involving an up-and-down or side-to-side gesture. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor is waving a plausible component of drawing a clockwise circle. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0382_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down motion that lacks the circular and directional specificity of the true action. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different motion patterns, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0383_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving hand,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'waving hand' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap with presenting or holding a stop sign. There is no temporal or categorical relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0384_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving hand,0.3,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a deliberate inward pulling motion of the hand (e.g., toward the body), while the prediction 'waving hand' implies a lateral or outward gestural movement. These actions differ significantly in intent and motion direction, making them semantically distinct. Although both involve hand movement, the mismatch in action type and purpose warrants a low score."
videos/session_0385_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing the hand away from the body, likely in a defensive or repelling gesture. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a different, typically rhythmic and friendly gesture involving hand movement, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of pushing away. While both involve hand motion, the intent and motion pattern differ significantly, making this a low-similarity match."

videos/session_0389_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Hand waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or prone position (e.g., sliding down a slide or across the floor). 'Hand waving' is a completely different upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding. There is no overlap in motion type, body posture, or intent, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0390_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movements in a controlled, repetitive angular motion. The prediction 'Waving' describes a broad, rhythmic arm motion typically used for greeting, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, the intent, trajectory, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0391_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Bending backward,0.6,"Bending backward can be a component of dodging (e.g., leaning back to avoid an object), making it semantically related. However, 'dodge' typically implies a more dynamic, evasive lateral or full-body movement, while 'bending backward' is more specific and static. This partial overlap warrants a medium score."
videos/session_0392_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: punching,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including arm swinging and ball release, typically in a forward motion. The predicted action 'punching' is a completely different upper-body motion with distinct biomechanics and intent.

videos/session_0408_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Pushing,0.3,"While both 'punchsomeone' and 'pushing' involve physical interaction, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Punching is a rapid, striking motion typically with a closed fist, whereas pushing involves sustained force with an open hand or body. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is pushing a typical temporal phase of punching. Thus, the match is partial at best, warranting a low score."

There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between these two actions."
videos/session_0441_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' specifically refers to forming a 'V' shape with the fingers, typically as a gesture. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture involving an extended index finger, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of making a victory sign. While both involve hand movements, they represent distinct gestures with different meanings and configurations."
videos/session_0442_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down hand motion that does not resemble drawing a circle. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in motion pattern or intent."
videos/session_0443_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down motion that lacks the circular and directional specificity of the true action. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different motion patterns, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0444_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a traffic or instructional context. The predicted action 'talking on the phone' is entirely unrelated and does not represent a temporal phase, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of 'stopsign'."
videos/session_0445_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward, possibly toward the body or face. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding and bringing a container to the mouth, which may involve a similar arm motion. However, without clear contextual evidence (e.g., presence of a cup), 'drinking' is a distinct semantic action and not a valid temporal phase or synonym of 'pullhandin'. Given the specificity of the label and lack of overlap in intent or typical execution, the prediction is considered incorrect."

These actions are biomechanically distinct and not temporally or semantically related. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0451_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Waving (raising both arms up and down),0.3,"While both 'jumpingjack' and 'waving (raising both arms up and down)' involve arm movement, jumping jacks are a full-body dynamic exercise that includes simultaneous leg abduction/adduction and coordinated arm motion overhead. Waving typically implies a more localized, often social gesture with less intensity and no leg involvement. The prediction captures partial motion but misses the essential full-body, rhythmic nature of jumping jacks, making it a related but significantly different action."

videos/session_0456_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'Walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible interpretation under which walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to a legraise."
videos/session_0457_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Boxing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated, non-combative manner. The predicted action 'Boxing' implies aggressive, combat-oriented punching motions, which are semantically and kinematically distinct from airdrumming. While both involve arm movement, the intent, motion pattern, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect prediction."

videos/session_0465_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve comparable body movements and intent, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained tool differentiation (mop vs. broom) may not be visible. While not identical, they are close enough in context and execution to warrant a high score."
videos/session_0466_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: saluting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to brush or comb their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'saluting' is a distinct gesture involving a rigid hand motion to the forehead, commonly associated with military protocol. While both actions involve raising a hand toward the head, the intent, motion pattern, and context are fundamentally different. There is no temporal or semantic overlap that would justify considering saluting as part of brushing hair, nor is it a plausible misinterpretation under thermal imaging constraints. Thus, the prediction is nearly incorrect."

videos/session_0469_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' is a different activity that may share superficial similarities (e.g., holding an object to the mouth), but it is not a temporal phase, semantic equivalent, or valid instance of brushing teeth. Given the distinct nature of the two actions, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0470_type.mp4,type,Action: Using a laptop while sitting,0.9,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing, which commonly occurs while using a laptop and sitting. The prediction 'Using a laptop while sitting' strongly implies typing and aligns semantically with the ground truth, even if it is slightly more descriptive.

The predicted action 'waving hand' describes a dynamic, rhythmic motion that is semantically and kinematically distinct from making a hand sign. While both involve hand movement, waving does not constitute a plausible temporal phase or variant of forming the 'OK' sign, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0474_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Hand waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically forming a 'V' with the index and middle fingers), while the predicted action 'Hand waving' describes a different, broader hand motion involving movement of the hand back and forth. Although both involve hand actions, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and visual forms. The prediction is not a temporal part nor a valid variant of making a victory sign, resulting in a low score."

The prediction 'Drinking from a container' describes a completely different activity with distinct hand-to-mouth motion and object interaction, which does not align semantically, temporally, or contextually with 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0479_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving hand', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, friendly motion. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion pattern differ significantly, making this a related but incorrect interpretation. Hence, it falls into the low-to-medium overlap range, leaning toward low due to the mismatch in action semantics."

videos/session_0486_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' is a specific, dynamic activity involving arm motion and approach toward a lane, while the prediction 'Walking' describes a generic locomotion action that does not capture any essential or temporal part of bowling. Although walking might occur during the approach phase of bowling, it is not sufficient to represent the core action, especially given the specificity of the 'bowling' label."
videos/session_0487_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving (raising one arm),0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' closely aligns with the predicted action 'Waving (raising one arm)', as both involve intentionally raising one arm. While 'waving' implies a repetitive or communicative motion and 'liftupahand' suggests a single upward movement, the core physical action—raising one arm—is semantically equivalent in this context, especially given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video which may obscure fine motion details."

videos/session_0498_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. Thus, it qualifies as a correct interpretation under temporal and contextual partiality."

'Hand waving' is a localized arm gesture with no inherent evasive or dynamic full-body motion, making it semantically unrelated to dodging. This constitutes a completely different action."
videos/session_0514_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Punching,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including arm swinging and ball release, typically in a forward motion. 'Punching' is a distinctly different action involving rapid, forceful extension of the arm, usually in a combat or exercise context. The two actions are not semantically related, nor is punching a plausible temporal part or variant of bowling. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0515_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video context and the focus on action similarity rather than lexical exactness, this prediction captures the core motion accurately."
videos/session_0516_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Saluting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand), while the predicted action 'saluting' is a distinct, formal gesture involving a specific arm and hand motion.

videos/session_0549_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' involves lateral or vertical head movement while remaining generally upright, whereas 'bowing' primarily involves forward flexion of the torso and head as a gesture of respect or greeting. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns and intent; bowing is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of shaking one's head."
videos/session_0550_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: talking on the phone,1.0,"The prediction 'talking on the phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."
videos/session_0551_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"Drinking is a distinct activity from eating, involving different objects (e.g., cup vs. food) and motions (sipping vs. chewing/swallowing). While both occur in similar contexts (e.g., at a table), they are semantically different actions with minimal temporal or functional overlap. Therefore, the prediction does not match the ground truth 'eat'."
videos/session_0552_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking from a cup/bottle,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking from a cup/bottle' is a precise and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0553_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'taking a photo' implies a completely different activity involving holding a device and capturing an image. There is no semantic overlap, temporal relationship, or plausible ambiguity between these two actions."
videos/session_0554_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down or reaching to lift an object, while 'bowing' is a distinct social or ceremonial gesture that may visually resemble bending but lacks the object-interaction intent central to 'pickup'. Although both involve forward torso movement, they are semantically different actions with different purposes, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0555_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping rope,1.0,The prediction 'Jumping rope' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumprope'.
videos/session_0556_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Playing golf (bending to putt with a club),0.1,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves repetitive sweeping motions with a mop, typically requiring bending and arm movement close to the floor. The predicted action 'Playing golf (bending to putt with a club)' describes a completely different activity with distinct posture, object use (golf club vs. mop), and context. While both may involve bending, the semantic and functional actions are unrelated, constituting a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0557_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (like a brush or comb), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion usually in response to an itch. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is scratching a typical temporal phase of brushing hair. Thus, the prediction is partially related but incorrect for the given ground truth."
videos/session_0558_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Punching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' involves flexing the elbow to lift a weight toward the shoulder, typically with controlled motion. 'Punching' is a distinct, high-velocity extension of the arm, often involving full arm extension and torso rotation. While both involve arm movement, they are biomechanically and semantically different actions with opposing motion patterns (flexion vs. extension). Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0564_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: raising hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which involves a specific hand configuration (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle). The prediction 'raising hand' describes a gross motor movement that does not capture the fine-grained hand posture required for the 'OK' sign. While raising a hand might be part of the process of making the gesture visible, it is not semantically equivalent nor a necessary temporal phase of forming the sign itself. Thus, the prediction is only loosely related and misses the core action."
videos/session_0565_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a raised hand “peace” (V-sign) gesture,1.0,"The predicted action 'Making a raised hand “peace” (V-sign) gesture' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both describe the same hand gesture (commonly known as a V-sign or victory sign)."
videos/session_0566_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down gesture that lacks the circular and directional specificity of the true action. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0567_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down motion that does not match the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a counterclockwise circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0568_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person interacting with or holding a stop sign, which is a specific contextual activity. The predicted action 'Waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to 'stopsign'.

videos/session_0577_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'bowling' refers to the sport involving rolling a ball toward pins, while the predicted action 'Bowing' (likely referring to bending forward as a gesture of respect) is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. Despite phonetic similarity, the actions are unrelated in meaning and context."
videos/session_0578_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one or both hands, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the inherent ambiguity in fine-grained hand motions, 'waving' is a reasonable and specific interpretation of the observed action."

There is no temporal or semantic overlap between running and dancing in this context."
videos/session_0700_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more dynamic gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0701_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Crawling on hands and knees,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden loss of balance and collapse to the ground, typically involving a rapid downward motion. In contrast, 'crawling on hands and knees' is a controlled, deliberate movement performed while already low to the ground and does not represent a fall or its immediate precursor (e.g., stumbling, losing balance). The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0702_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Crouching / Squatting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, explosive movement involving leaving the ground, whereas the predicted action 'crouching / squatting' describes a static or preparatory low-body posture that does not involve jumping. While crouching might precede a jump, it is not a sufficient or characteristic part of the jumping action itself in most contexts, especially without evidence of upward motion. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."

There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0777_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drinking,0.3,"While 'drinking' and 'eating' are both consumption-related activities, they are distinct actions with different semantic meanings. The ground truth 'eat' specifically refers to consuming solid food, whereas 'drinking' involves liquids. Given the context of Human Activity Recognition and the specificity of the label 'eat', predicting 'drinking' constitutes a related but incorrect action, falling into the low-score range due to the lack of temporal or categorical overlap."

Given the low-resolution thermal video input, the VLM may not distinguish between a mop and a broom, and both actions fall under the same functional category of floor cleaning. This constitutes a strong semantic match, warranting a high score."
videos/session_0783_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Saluting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming behavior near the head, typically with repetitive hand-to-hair motion. 'Saluting' is a distinct gesture involving a rigid hand movement to the forehead, usually in a military context. While both involve hand movement near the head, the intent, motion pattern, and semantic meaning are fundamentally different. This constitutes a nearly complete mismatch, warranting a very low score."

This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic activity, which falls under the low-score category per the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0887_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping hands,1.0,"The prediction 'Clapping hands' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'clap', describing the same specific activity with slightly more detail."
videos/session_0888_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Punching,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' involves a smooth, gliding motion typically along a surface, while the predicted action 'punching' is a sharp, forceful upper-body movement. These actions are fundamentally different in motion dynamics, body involvement, and intent, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0889_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Saluting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movement in a specific trajectory. The predicted action 'Saluting' is a distinct, unrelated gesture with a different purpose and motion pattern. There is no semantic, temporal, or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0890_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a dynamic, evasive movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture. Standing is not a temporal part of dodging, nor is it semantically related or a plausible component of the action.

There is no overlap in intent, motion, or context."
videos/session_0894_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is minimal overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body parts involved, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0895_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a different, rhythmic side-to-side or up-and-down arm motion with no indication of forming a geometric shape. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0896_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Taking a photo (using a camera),0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'taking a photo (using a camera)' involves deliberate upper-body movement and object interaction. These actions are semantically and physically unrelated, with no temporal or contextual overlap."

videos/session_0898_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: bending down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty. The prediction 'bending down' describes a controlled, deliberate motion that is not temporally or semantically related to staggering. While both involve body movement, they represent fundamentally different actions with distinct intent and dynamics."
videos/session_0899_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies holding and consuming a liquid. These are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of yawning or vice versa, especially in the context of thermal video where such distinct upper-body/head motions would be distinguishable."
videos/session_0900_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, typically with arm movement near the face. The predicted action 'taking a photo' implies holding a device and aiming it outward, which is visually and semantically unrelated.

videos/session_0903_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Picking up an object from the ground,0.2,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a repetitive, sweeping motion with a mop, typically while standing and moving across the floor. The predicted action 'picking up an object from the ground' describes a distinct, momentary bending or squatting motion that is not a typical component of mopping. While both involve interaction with the floor, the core actions are semantically different and not temporally or functionally aligned."
videos/session_0904_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (e.g., a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion usually in response to an itch. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is scratching a logical temporal phase of brushing hair. Thus, the prediction is partially related but incorrect for the given ground truth."
videos/session_0905_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Waving' involves arm movement but is a distinct social gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0906_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: texting on a smartphone,1.0,"The prediction 'texting on a smartphone' is a specific and semantically equivalent instance of the ground truth action 'playphone', which broadly refers to interacting with a mobile phone."
videos/session_0907_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The prediction 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a different activity with distinct motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with minimal overlap in context or motion, especially in thermal video where fine details are limited but gross motion differs."
videos/session_0908_type.mp4,type,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements typically while seated. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap.

videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'hand waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or random hand movement that lacks the precise circular trajectory and directional intent of drawing a circle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically side-to-side or up-and-down—and does not closely resemble the precise circular motion required. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person mimicking or holding a stop sign gesture (typically an arm extended with an open palm), which is a specific static pose. 'Hand waving' is a distinctly different dynamic gesture involving repetitive motion, and does not represent the same action or a valid temporal part of it. The two actions serve different communicative purposes and are not semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a distinctly different motion—typically an outward, repetitive gesture used for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the directionality and intent differ significantly, making this a mismatch rather than a temporal or semantic variant."
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Using a smartphone / texting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving pushing or repelling with the hand, likely in a social or defensive context. The predicted action 'Using a smartphone / texting' describes a completely different, fine-motor activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with the ground truth. There is no plausible interpretation under which texting constitutes a part of or equivalent to 'pushhandaway'."
