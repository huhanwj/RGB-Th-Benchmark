videos/session_0912_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a phone call,0.0,Making a phone call is semantically unrelated to making a victory sign; the two actions involve different hand gestures and contexts.
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving arm,0.3,'Waving arm' is an arm movement but does not involve the circular drawing motion implied by 'drawcircleclockwise'; the actions are only loosely related and not semantically equivalent.
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.0,'Pointing' is a completely different motion from drawing a circle counter-clockwise; no semantic or temporal overlap exists.
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand waving,0.0,"'Hand waving' is a completely different motion from the ground truth 'stopsign' (a static pose with arm extended), so they are semantically unrelated."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Phone Call,0.2,"'Phone Call' involves holding a phone to the ear and talking, whereas 'pullhandin' suggests pulling something toward the body with the hand. The two actions are semantically unrelated and describe different contexts and motions."
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Draw,0.0,"'Draw' (as in sketching or doodling) is semantically unrelated to 'pushhandaway' (a defensive gesture of pushing someone's hand away). The actions describe entirely different intents and body motions, so the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0918_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Reaching up,0.3,"'Reaching up' is an arm-raising motion that is not semantically equivalent to a hand-wave; while both involve arm movement, a wave is a distinct, repetitive side-to-side gesture. The actions are only loosely related and the prediction is too generic to count as a correct match."
videos/session_0919_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Phone Call,0.0,The predicted action 'Phone Call' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'sweep'; there is no semantic or contextual overlap between making a phone call and sweeping.

videos/session_0933_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"Coughing and blowing one’s nose are distinct respiratory actions; while both involve the face/head region, they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a temporal part of the other. The prediction is only loosely related and thus warrants a low score."
videos/session_0934_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Bending backward,0.85,"Bending backward is a direct and common way to stretch oneself, so the predicted action is semantically equivalent to the ground truth."
videos/session_0935_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Coughing,0.3,"'Coughing' involves a hand-to-face motion that can overlap with 'touchface', but it is primarily a respiratory action rather than a deliberate face-touching gesture.

videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Pushing,0.25,"'Pushing' and 'kicksomeone' are both aggressive contact actions, but they involve different body parts and motions (pushing with hands vs. kicking with foot). The prediction is related but not close enough to be considered a medium match, so it falls into the low-score range."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Dodge,0.3,"'Dodge' is a defensive reaction to being punched, not the act of punching itself. While loosely related to the same aggressive scenario, it is not a temporal part of 'punchsomeone' and describes the opposite role in the interaction."
