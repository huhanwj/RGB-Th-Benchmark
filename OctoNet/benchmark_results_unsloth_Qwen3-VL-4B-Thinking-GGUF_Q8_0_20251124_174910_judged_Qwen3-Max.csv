videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sitting,1.0,The prediction 'sitting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sit'.
videos/session_0002_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'bending' accurately captures the core physical motion of bowing, even if it lacks the contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement rather than intent, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid match."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verb match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. This qualifies as a logical and correct interpretation under temporal partiality and action similarity considerations."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: wave,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic full-body movement, while the prediction 'wave' describes a limited, isolated arm gesture. Although waving can occur during dancing, it is not representative of the core activity and is too generic/specific to be considered a valid instance or temporal part of 'dance'. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent or temporal parts of each other. Jogging implies a faster pace and higher intensity than walking. While the prediction is plausible and in the same general category, it lacks the specificity required for a high score, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: falling,1.0,"The prediction 'falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same event with slightly different phrasing."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Throw,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'Throw' involves a distinct upper-body motion typically directed outward or forward. These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in motion pattern or intent. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jump_rope,0.3,"While both 'jumpingjack' and 'jump_rope' are dynamic, rhythmic exercises involving jumping, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping jacks involve lateral arm and leg movements, whereas jump rope involves rotating a rope and vertical jumps. The VLM's prediction is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or a valid instance under an abstract label of the ground truth. Thus, it is a related but incorrect action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: stretching,0.3,"While both 'squat' and 'stretching' are physical activities, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. A squat involves bending the knees and hips to lower the body, typically as a strength exercise, whereas stretching generally refers to elongating muscles, often in a static or slow-moving manner. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase of squatting nor is it semantically equivalent. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'squat', 'stretching' is a related but incorrect action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' refers to a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step and knee bend, typically static or repetitive in form. The prediction 'dancing' implies a rhythmic, full-body movement that is generally distinct in motion pattern and intent from a lunge. While both are dynamic activities, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor does 'dancing' fall under a plausible interpretation of 'lunge'. Thus, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' refers to a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not inherently involve turning, nor is it a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: falling,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving controlled movement. The prediction 'falling' describes an uncontrolled, accidental motion that is semantically and physically distinct from performing a pushup. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'Walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible interpretation under which walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to a legraise."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, dynamic arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion. The predicted action 'pointing' is a static or singular gesture involving one arm and finger extension, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from airdrumming. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: clapping,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, aggressive arm movements such as punching, while the predicted action 'clapping' is a distinctly different motion involving hands coming together in front of the body. Although both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically dissimilar, and clapping is not a plausible temporal phase or variant of boxing."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, and 'Standing' fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of 'shakehead'."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drink,0.3,"While 'drink' and 'eat' are both consumption-related actions, they are distinct activities with different motions and intents. In the context of HAR, especially with thermal video where fine details may be limited, mistaking drinking for eating is a plausible error but not semantically equivalent or a temporal part of the same action. Therefore, it falls into the low-score range due to being a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The prediction 'drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: talking on phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'talking on phone' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where talking on a phone would be considered a part of or equivalent to wiping one's face."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending over' is a key and characteristic component of the 'pickup' action, as picking something up typically involves bending at the waist or knees. While not an exact lexical match, it accurately describes the primary motion observed in the activity, making it a semantically valid and temporally appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves repetitive jumping motion. The prediction 'jumping' captures the core dynamic movement of jumprope, even if it omits the specific use of a rope. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on action similarity rather than exactness, this is a highly accurate and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Pointing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a person actively cleaning the floor with a mop, typically involving sweeping or wiping motions with a tool. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a completely different gesture that does not correspond to any plausible phase or component of mopping. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: talking on a phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person actively grooming their hair, typically with a brush or hand near the head. The predicted action 'talking on a phone' describes a completely different activity with distinct hand and head posture (e.g., holding a phone to the ear). There is no semantic overlap, temporal relationship, or plausible ambiguity between the two actions."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is a communicative gesture with a distinctly different motion pattern, intent, and muscle engagement. The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: speaking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves a specific hygiene-related activity typically performed near a sink with arm movements near the face. The predicted action 'speaking' is unrelated in both motion pattern and semantic meaning, and does not represent a temporal phase or plausible variant of brushing teeth."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential activity of typing. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially since 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs-up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs-up' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in hyphenation and pluralization, which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct intent and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture (forming an 'OK' sign with the hand), while the predicted action 'waving' describes a different, unrelated hand motion. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and visual patterns, even in low-resolution thermal video. This constitutes a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' specifically refers to forming a 'V' shape with the fingers, typically as a gesture. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a single finger to indicate direction or focus, which is a distinctly different hand gesture. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, and pointing is not a temporal phase or variant of making a victory sign."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down gesture that does not resemble drawing a circle. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in motion pattern or intent."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically side-to-side or up-and-down gesture that lacks the circular and directional specificity of the true action. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: take selfie,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is interacting with or holding a stop sign, likely in a traffic or safety-related context. The predicted action 'take selfie' is entirely unrelated and does not represent a temporal phase, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of 'stopsign'. There is no meaningful overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion involving pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a distinctly different hand gesture that involves extending the finger outward, which is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of pulling the hand in. The actions are functionally and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, outward pushing motion with the hand, likely involving force or resistance. The prediction 'pointing' is a distinctly different gesture that involves extending a finger to indicate direction or focus, lacking the pushing or repelling motion central to 'pushhandaway'. The two actions are not temporally related nor semantically equivalent, and 'pointing' does not fall under a plausible interpretation or sub-component of 'pushhandaway'."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are visually and semantically dissimilar, especially in a thermal video where contextual cues are limited, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Pointing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'Pointing' is a static gesture with no relation to sliding. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden directional changes. The predicted action 'walking' describes a slow, steady, and linear motion that is semantically and kinematically distinct from dodging. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would make walking a valid part of dodging, nor is it a plausible abstraction or specific instance of the action. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: bending,0.6,"Bending is a common component of the bowling action (e.g., during the approach or release), but it is not specific enough to fully capture the distinct activity of bowling. While related, 'bending' alone could describe many other actions and lacks the contextual specificity of bowling (e.g., arm swing, ball release). Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a plausible but less specific prediction."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this prediction captures the essential motion and intent of the action."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a distinct, broader arm motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a single finger and is functionally and kinematically distinct from the coordinated multi-finger motion of 'spreadandpinch'. While both involve hand movements, they serve different purposes and exhibit different motion patterns, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle or its temporal components (e.g., moving hand in three connected straight lines). While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and trajectory, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: bow,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'bow' is a deliberate, full-body movement involving bending at the waist. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0050_cough.mp4,cough,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between coughing and drinking, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas 'walking' suggests a steady, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' fails to capture the distinctive instability inherent in 'staggering,' making it a related but significantly different action. Thus, it falls into the low-score range due to missing the key characteristic of the true activity."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-opening gesture typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding and consuming a beverage. These actions are visually and semantically distinct in thermal video, with no temporal or contextual overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, typically with an arm raised to the face. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container to the mouth and consuming liquid—these are entirely different actions with distinct hand-to-face movements and purposes. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: raising arms,0.9,"Raising arms is a common and specific movement involved in stretching oneself, making it a semantically valid and temporally plausible part of the ground truth action 'stretchoneself'."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: talking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their face, which is a specific and localized gesture. The predicted action 'talking' is a completely different behavior that does not inherently involve touching the face. While someone might occasionally touch their face while talking, the actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or plausibly interchangeable in this context. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0057_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: handshake,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful or intentional physical contact to move another person, whereas the predicted action 'handshake' describes a consensual, friendly gesture. These actions differ significantly in intent, dynamics, and physical interaction, making them semantically distinct. While both involve person-to-person contact, the nature of the interaction is fundamentally different, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a specific aggressive or contact-oriented motion directed at another person. The prediction 'dancing' describes a rhythmic, non-aggressive activity that does not involve kicking someone. While both are dynamic actions, they differ significantly in intent, interaction, and motion semantics, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: greeting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion toward another person, while the predicted action 'greeting' suggests a friendly, non-aggressive social interaction. These actions are semantically and behaviorally distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering one a valid part of the other."
videos/session_0061_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: pointing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies a social interaction typically involving talking and listening, possibly with gestures. While 'pointing' can occur during a conversation as a supplementary gesture, it is not sufficient on its own to represent the core activity of conversing. The prediction focuses on a specific gesture rather than the overarching interactive behavior, making it only weakly related."
videos/session_0062_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sitting,1.0,The prediction 'sitting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sit'.
videos/session_0063_walk.mp4,walk,Action: walking,1.0,The prediction 'walking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'walk'.

videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a highly plausible and semantically appropriate posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially low-resolution ones, distinguishing between lying still and actual sleep is challenging, and 'lying' is a core component of the sleeping activity."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: arm raise,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Arm raise' is a plausible component of dancing and represents a specific, active motion consistent with dance-like behavior. However, it is less specific and could also occur in non-dance contexts (e.g., stretching, signaling), so it doesn't fully capture the expressive or rhythmic nature typically associated with dance. Thus, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jog' is a dynamic, locomotive activity, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture with no movement. Standing is not a temporal part of jogging (e.g., starting or stopping to jog would involve motion), nor is it a plausible interpretation of the activity. This constitutes a generic static description for a clearly dynamic label, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0070_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: dancing,0.6,"Jumping jacks and dancing are both dynamic, full-body movements often performed in exercise or freestyle contexts. While not the same action, they share kinematic similarities (rhythmic, repetitive motion involving arms and legs). However, 'dancing' is not a precise match or a direct temporal part of 'jumpingjack', placing it in the medium-similarity range."
videos/session_0071_squat.mp4,squat,Action: punch,0.0,"The ground truth action 'squat' involves bending the knees and lowering the body, typically as part of exercise or resting. The predicted action 'punch' is a completely different upper-body movement with no semantic or temporal overlap with squatting.

videos/session_0073_turn.mp4,turn,Action: looking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'looking' suggests a head or gaze movement without necessarily involving body rotation. Although 'looking' might sometimes accompany 'turning', it is not a sufficient or accurate representation of the core action 'turn', especially in a thermal video where full-body motion is key. The prediction is related but too generic and misses the primary dynamic of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bow,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving lowering and raising the body. The predicted action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist while standing or kneeling, which is a different motion with distinct posture and intent. Although both may involve a bent torso, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor does 'bow' fall under a broader category that includes 'pushup'. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0075_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'legraise' is a dynamic, specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'standing' describes a static posture that does not capture any part of the legraise motion. Given the dynamic nature of 'legraise', a generic static label like 'standing' is incorrect and falls under the low-score category."
videos/session_0076_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: gesturing,0.6,"The ground truth 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm and hand gestures. The prediction 'gesturing' is related but overly broad and lacks specificity—it could describe many non-drumming actions. While it captures the general idea of arm movement, it misses the distinctive rhythmic and performative nature of airdrumming, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0077_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punching,1.0,"The prediction 'Punching' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'. It is a specific and accurate representation of the activity, fully consistent with the expected behavior under the 'boxing' label."

There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between these two actions, and 'drinking' does not represent a plausible part or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0083_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down to lift an object, which may include partial forward bending or squatting. However, 'bowing' typically implies a respectful or ceremonial forward bend of the torso without object interaction, and lacks the grasping or lifting component central to 'pickup'. While there is slight postural overlap, the intent and motion are fundamentally different, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0084_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: greet,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a specific, dynamic activity involving rhythmic jumping. The predicted action 'greet' is a completely different social gesture, typically involving waving or verbal acknowledgment, with no overlap in motion pattern or intent. There is no temporal or semantic relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0085_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: bending,0.6,"Mopping the floor typically involves bending over to reach the floor, so 'bending' is a plausible and related component of the action. However, 'bending' alone is less specific and could describe many other activities (e.g., picking something up, tying shoes). While it captures a key motion in mopping, it doesn't fully convey the complete activity, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0086_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Salute,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to groom their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'Salute' is a distinct gesture involving raising the hand to the forehead in a formal or military context. While both actions involve hand movement near the head, they are semantically and functionally different with no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0087_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is a distinct social gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0088_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically while stationary or minimally moving. The predicted action 'walking' describes locomotion and is semantically unrelated to phone usage. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between walking and playing with a phone in this context, making the prediction completely incorrect."
videos/session_0089_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch."
videos/session_0090_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially since 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0091_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is raised, typically as a sign of approval. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the index finger to indicate direction or object, which is a distinctly different hand gesture. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, and pointing is not a temporal phase or variant of thumb-up. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0092_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form.

Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intent and form, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0094_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the hand with index and middle fingers extended in a V shape). The prediction 'waving' describes a different hand motion involving repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down movement. While both involve hand actions, they are semantically and visually distinct gestures with different intents, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0095_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand motion, likely in front of the body.

The prediction 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. There is no temporal or conceptual overlap between pointing and drawing a counterclockwise circle, making this a nearly complete mismatch."
videos/session_0097_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no indication that waving is a temporal part of presenting or holding a stop sign, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0098_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: gesturing,0.3,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a specific action involving pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled motion. The prediction 'gesturing' is too generic and does not clearly capture the directional or intentional nature of 'pullhandin'. While gesturing could involve hand movement, it lacks the specificity and intent implied by the ground truth, placing it in the low-score range."
videos/session_0099_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension to indicate direction or object, with no inherent pushing or repelling motion. These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with minimal overlap in intent or movement pattern."
videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: pointing,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'pointing' involve arm movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. Handwaving typically involves a side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand to greet or signal, whereas pointing is a directed gesture using a finger to indicate direction or object. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'pointing' does not qualify as an exact match, temporal part, or semantic equivalent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0101_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, dynamic motion typically using a broom or similar tool to clean a surface. The predicted action 'pointing' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or temporal overlap with sweeping. There is no plausible scenario where pointing constitutes a part of or a valid interpretation of sweeping, especially given the constraints of the task."
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: waving,0.3,"While both 'clap' and 'waving' involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. Clapping involves hands moving toward each other to strike, while waving typically involves a side-to-side or up-and-down motion of one or both hands without contact. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase or equivalent of clapping, nor is it a plausible abstraction under the given constraints."
videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: pointing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'pointing' is a static gesture with no meaningful overlap in motion semantics or intent.

videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: salute,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movement. The predicted action 'salute' is a distinct, unrelated gesture with no semantic or temporal overlap with drawing. There is no plausible interpretation under which saluting constitutes part of or an equivalent to drawing a zigzag."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: looking around,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a dynamic, evasive movement, typically involving quick lateral or directional shifts to avoid something. The prediction 'looking around' describes a static or observational behavior with no indication of evasion or rapid motion. These actions are semantically unrelated and belong to different activity categories—active avoidance vs. passive observation—resulting in a very low match score."
videos/session_0106_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: throw,0.9,"The predicted action 'throw' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves throwing or rolling a ball toward pins. Given the temporal and semantic alignment, this is a highly accurate prediction."
videos/session_0107_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this prediction captures the essential motion and intent of the action."
videos/session_0108_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a distinct, broader hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0109_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a single finger and is functionally and kinematically distinct from the coordinated multi-finger motion of 'spreadandpinch'. While both involve hand movements, they serve different purposes and exhibit different motion patterns, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0110_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically lead to drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: sneezing,1.0,"The prediction 'sneezing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'sneeze', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."

videos/session_0113_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical nuance of instability inherent to 'stagger', making it a related but significantly different action. Thus, it falls into the low-to-medium overlap range, closer to low due to the loss of key semantic detail."
videos/session_0114_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouth inhalation typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different and unrelated behavior.

videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying down' is a valid and highly indicative posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine-grained cues are limited. This aligns with the criteria for a high score as it represents a logical and semantically appropriate interpretation of the activity."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: raising hands,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Raising hands' is a plausible and specific motion commonly associated with dancing, especially in freestyle or expressive contexts. While not an exact match, it is a valid component of the broader 'dance' category."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0130_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: falling,1.0,"The prediction 'falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same event with slightly different phrasing."
videos/session_0131_jump.mp4,jump,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'throwing' involves primarily upper-body motion and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between jumping and throwing, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a dynamic, full-body exercise involving repeated jumping and arm movements. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture with no motion, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the energetic and repetitive nature of jumping jacks. According to the evaluation criteria, assigning a generic static label to a clearly dynamic action warrants a low score."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a dynamic, lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically with movement downward and upward. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static, upright posture with no indication of squatting motion or its temporal phases (e.g., lowering into a squat or rising from one). Since 'standing' is not a logical temporal part of 'squat' and fails to capture any aspect of the intended dynamic action, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0134_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Squatting,0.6,"Both 'lunge' and 'squatting' are lower-body strength exercises involving bending the knees and lowering the body, and they share similar visual postures in thermal video. However, they are distinct movements: a lunge involves one leg forward and the other back, while a squat is typically performed with feet side-by-side. Given the low-resolution thermal input, confusion is understandable, but the actions are not temporally or semantically equivalent—only related. Hence, a medium score is appropriate."
videos/session_0135_turn.mp4,turn,Action: head turn,1.0,"The prediction 'head turn' is a specific and valid instance of the ground truth action 'turn', as turning the head is a natural and common form of turning in human activity."
videos/session_0136_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving repeated lowering and raising of the body. The predicted action 'bowing' typically involves a forward bend from a standing position, often static or ceremonial, and does not share significant kinematic or functional similarity with a pushup. While both involve bending at the waist or upper body, the motion patterns, intent, and muscle engagement are fundamentally different. Therefore, this is considered a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0137_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific, controlled exercise movement typically performed lying down or hanging, involving lifting the legs. The prediction 'dancing' describes a broad, rhythmic, and often full-body activity that is semantically and kinematically distinct from a legraise. While both are dynamic, dancing does not reasonably encompass or approximate a legraise, nor is it a temporal phase of it. Thus, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: gesturing,0.6,"The ground truth 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm and hand gestures. The prediction 'gesturing' is related but overly broad and lacks specificity—it could describe many non-drumming actions.

videos/session_0148_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to brush or comb their hair, typically with repetitive, controlled arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'waving' describes a broad, outward arm motion usually directed away from the body, often for greeting or signaling. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and spatial location, making them semantically unrelated. There is no plausible temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering 'waving' as part of 'brushhair'."

The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, pointing lacks the structured, multi-directional movement required to form a triangle and is not a logical temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'drawtriangle'."

These actions are physiologically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0174_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic respiratory action, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture unrelated to coughing. Standing does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of coughing, nor is it a plausible component of the action. This constitutes a completely different and incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0175_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical instability inherent to 'staggering', making it a significantly different action rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."

There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between them."
videos/session_0178_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: dancing,0.6,"The ground truth 'stretchoneself' refers to deliberate stretching movements, while the prediction 'dancing' implies a different category of rhythmic or expressive motion. Although both are dynamic and could involve limb movement, they are not semantically equivalent nor is dancing a typical component of stretching. However, in low-resolution thermal video, some stretching motions might resemble dance-like movements, leading to a plausible but incorrect interpretation—hence a medium score."

videos/session_0185_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which often involves gestures, head movements, or postural shifts, even if participants are standing. However, the prediction 'standing' is a generic static description that fails to capture the core interactive nature of 'conversation'. While standing can occur during a conversation, labeling the action solely as 'standing' omits the essential semantic component of communication, making it insufficiently specific and only weakly related."

videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a clear temporal part of the other. While both involve forward motion on foot, jogging implies a faster pace and higher intensity than walking. Given the similarity in motion type but difference in intensity, this is a related but less specific prediction, falling into the medium score range."

videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: golf swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'golf swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive sweeping motions with a mop, typically close to the ground and using both hands, while a golf swing is a distinct, sport-specific motion involving a club and a very different posture and movement pattern. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.6,"The predicted action 'touching head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks specificity.

Although both involve hand actions, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and visual forms, especially in thermal video where fine details may be limited but gross motion patterns differ. Thus, the prediction is not a temporal part, synonym, or valid instance of the ground truth."

The prediction 'pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension toward a direction or object, with no inherent pushing or repelling intent. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion, and semantics, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0224_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a clear, dynamic arm movement with an open hand to greet or signal, while the predicted action 'pointing' typically involves extending a finger or hand in a specific direction. Although both involve arm/hand motion, they serve different communicative intents and have distinct kinematic patterns.

Although dancing can involve clapping, the prediction does not reflect the specific action shown in the clip and instead generalizes to a different high-level category. Given the specificity of 'clap', this constitutes a largely incorrect prediction."

videos/session_0230_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: walk,0.2,"The ground truth action 'bowling' is a specific, dynamic activity involving arm motion and ball release, typically preceded or followed by walking. However, predicting only 'walk' misses the core bowling action and reduces it to a generic locomotion activity that could occur in many contexts. While walking might be part of the approach in bowling, it is not sufficient to represent the labeled activity, especially since the thermal clip should capture the distinctive upper-body motion of bowling. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."

The predicted action 'Waving' involves a different hand motion (typically moving the hand side-to-side or up-and-down as a greeting). While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct gestures with different intents and visual forms, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0343_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically a back-and-forth or up-and-down motion—and does not resemble the continuous, circular trajectory required for drawing a circle. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0344_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions.
videos/session_0345_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. Waving does not constitute a temporal phase or valid interpretation of 'stopsign'."
videos/session_0346_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a rhythmic, communicative motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both involve hand movement, they serve different purposes and exhibit opposing motion patterns (inward pull vs. outward wave), making them largely dissimilar. Thus, the prediction is considered incorrect with only minimal overlap in involving hand motion."
videos/session_0347_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The prediction 'pointing' is a distinctly different gesture that involves extending a finger to indicate direction or draw attention, lacking the defensive or repelling nature of 'pushhandaway'. The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same action category, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: jump,0.3,"While both 'jog' and 'jump' are dynamic actions, they are distinct in nature and intent. Jogging involves continuous forward locomotion with rhythmic steps, whereas jumping is a vertical or explosive movement not inherently part of jogging. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase of jogging nor a semantic equivalent, placing it in the low-score range."
videos/session_0354_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sit-up,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden loss of balance and collapse to the ground, which is fundamentally different from 'sit-up', a controlled, intentional core exercise performed while lying down. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion dynamics, and posture, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0355_jump.mp4,jump,Action: dancing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a specific, dynamic movement involving propulsion off the ground. 'Dancing' is a broad category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent nor a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the clip shows dance-specific motions, this prediction is only loosely related and overly generic for the given GT."
videos/session_0356_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping,0.9,"The predicted action 'jumping' is highly similar to the ground truth 'jumpingjack', as jumping jacks involve repeated jumping motions with arm and leg movements. While not an exact match, 'jumping' captures the core dynamic and is a plausible interpretation of the activity in a low-resolution thermal video."
videos/session_0357_squat.mp4,squat,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a specific lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically performed in place. The predicted action 'dancing' implies a broader, rhythmic, and often full-body movement that is not semantically equivalent or a temporal part of squatting.

videos/session_0362_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0363_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: dancing,0.3,"While both 'boxing' and 'dancing' involve dynamic upper-body movements, they are semantically distinct activities with different intents and motion patterns. Boxing is a combat sport with specific punching and defensive motions, whereas dancing is expressive and rhythmic. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase of boxing nor a valid instance under an abstract label. Thus, it is largely incorrect but receives a minimal score due to shared dynamism."

There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between these two actions, and 'drinking' does not represent a plausible part or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0369_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending' is a key and necessary component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking up an object typically involves bending down. This represents a logical temporal part of the action, satisfying the evaluation criteria for a high score."
videos/session_0370_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jig,0.1,"The predicted action 'jig' is not semantically related to the ground truth 'jumprope'. A 'jig' typically refers to a type of dance or a rapid tapping motion, which does not align with the rhythmic, vertical jumping motion characteristic of jump roping. Given the specificity of 'jumprope' as a dynamic, well-defined activity, this prediction constitutes a significant mismatch."
videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.6,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are distinct cleaning actions involving different tools and motions, but they are semantically related as floor-cleaning activities. While not equivalent, the prediction shows reasonable contextual understanding, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0372_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.6,"The predicted action 'touching head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks specificity. Brushing hair implies a repeated, grooming motion, whereas 'touching head' could refer to a brief or incidental contact.

The predicted action 'wave' involves a different hand motion (typically moving the hand side-to-side or up-and-down) and does not correspond to making the 'OK' sign. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and visual forms, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0380_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: hand gesture,0.9,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' is a specific hand gesture, and the prediction 'hand gesture' accurately captures the semantic category of the action.

There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0390_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape.

These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0398_cough.mp4,cough,Action: hand to face,0.6,"The predicted action 'hand to face' is a plausible and commonly associated gesture during coughing, as people often cover their mouth when coughing. However, it is not a definitive indicator of coughing on its own, as the same motion could occur in other contexts (e.g., scratching face, adjusting glasses). Thus, it is related but less specific than the ground truth 'cough'."
videos/session_0399_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait.

videos/session_0415_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a clear temporal part of the other. While both involve forward motion on foot, jogging implies a faster pace and higher intensity than walking. Given the similarity in motion type but difference in intensity, this is a related but less specific prediction, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0416_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: push_up,0.0,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'push_up' describes a controlled, intentional exercise movement performed while on the ground.

videos/session_0515_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: waving,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' describes raising a hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically involves lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video context and the high-level nature of labels, this is a reasonable and closely related interpretation."
videos/session_0516_tap.mp4,tap,Action: touching face,0.9,"The ground truth action 'tap' typically involves a light touch, often on the face or body. The prediction 'touching face' is a specific and plausible instance of tapping, especially in a thermal video where fine details may be ambiguous. Given the semantic similarity and contextual plausibility, this is considered a near-exact match."
videos/session_0517_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: looking up,0.0,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading and pinching motions, likely with fingers. The predicted action 'looking up' describes a head/eye movement that is entirely unrelated to the hand-based action in the ground truth. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0518_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion to trace or form a triangle shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a generic gesture that does not capture the structured, multi-directional movement required to draw a triangle. While pointing might be a component of drawing, it is insufficient and semantically distinct from the full action, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0519_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'drinking' involves a deliberate, manual activity of consuming liquid. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0520_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture unrelated to coughing. Coughing may occur while standing, but 'standing' alone does not capture or imply the act of coughing, especially given the thermal video context where such transient actions should be discernible. This constitutes a mismatch between a dynamic action and a generic static description."
videos/session_0521_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical instability inherent to 'staggering', making it a significantly different action rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0522_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: coughing,0.2,"Yawning and coughing are distinct physiological actions with different visual manifestations, even in low-resolution thermal video. While both involve head and mouth movement, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or interchangeable under any abstract label. The prediction does not align with the ground truth action."
videos/session_0523_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video due to head/upper body motion, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and mechanics. Blowing one's nose typically involves using a tissue and deliberate hand-to-face contact, whereas coughing is a reflexive expulsion of air. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal phase of the other. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0524_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: dancing,0.6,"While 'dancing' is not an exact match for 'stretchoneself', both involve deliberate body movements and can overlap in practice (e.g., dynamic stretching may resemble dance-like motions). However, dancing is a distinct activity with different intent and typical motion patterns, so it is related but not fully equivalent or a clear temporal part of stretching. This falls into the medium score range due to plausible but ambiguous similarity."
videos/session_0525_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: touching mouth,1.0,"The predicted action 'touching mouth' is a specific instance of the ground truth action 'touchface', as touching the mouth involves touching part of the face. This is a semantically equivalent and valid interpretation."

These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0530_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: handshake,0.0,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' involves an aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person, while the predicted action 'handshake' is a cooperative, friendly gesture. These actions are semantically and physically opposite in intent and execution, with no temporal or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0531_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' is a dynamic, aggressive movement involving arm extension and forceful contact. The prediction 'standing' describes a static, neutral posture with no indication of aggression or motion. This is a completely different action and fails to capture any temporal or semantic aspect of punching."

videos/session_0533_sit.mp4,sit,Action: bowing,0.2,"The predicted action 'bowing' is a distinct posture involving bending forward at the waist, typically from a standing position, and is not a temporal phase (like sitting down or standing up) of the ground truth action 'sit'. While both involve changes in body posture, they serve different functional purposes and are not semantically equivalent or temporally related in the context of sitting."

videos/session_0536_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verb match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent. This qualifies as a logical and valid interpretation under temporal partiality and semantic equivalence."
videos/session_0537_dance.mp4,dance,Action: stretching,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement typically involving the whole body. While 'stretching' is a physical activity, it is generally slow, static, and not rhythmically coordinated like dance. Although both are forms of movement, stretching is not a typical component or semantic equivalent of dancing, nor is it a plausible temporal phase of dance. Therefore, the prediction is only loosely related and warrants a low score."
videos/session_0538_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walk,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'walk' is less intense than 'jog' and not a direct temporal part of jogging (e.g., starting or stopping to jog), it falls into the medium similarity range."

While not semantically equivalent, they are related as rhythmic physical activities. However, 'dancing' is less specific and not a direct temporal part or synonym of 'jumpingjack', placing it in the medium score range."

videos/session_0543_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: jumping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' refers to a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step and knee bend, while the predicted action 'jumping' is a distinctly different dynamic movement primarily involving vertical propulsion. Although both are active exercises, they involve different mechanics, muscle groups, and motion patterns, making them semantically dissimilar in the context of HAR."
videos/session_0544_turn.mp4,turn,Action: looking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'looking' suggests only a head or gaze movement without necessarily involving a full-body turn. Although looking can accompany turning, it is not a sufficient or equivalent representation of the action 'turn', especially in a HAR context where whole-body motion is typically emphasized. Thus, the prediction is related but too weak and static to be considered correct."

There is no temporal or conceptual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0548_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, aggressive arm movements in a fighting context, while the predicted action 'waving' is a slow, non-aggressive gesture typically used for greeting or signaling. Although both involve arm motion, the intent, speed, and context are fundamentally different, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0549_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: looking down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' involves a distinct lateral or vertical head movement, while the prediction 'looking down' describes a static head orientation without the characteristic motion of shaking. These are semantically different actions, and 'looking down' does not represent a temporal phase or variant of head shaking."
videos/session_0550_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' implies interacting with a phone, typically involving holding it to the ear or using it in some way.

videos/session_0554_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bow,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down to lift an object, which may include a brief forward bend or squat. However, 'bow' typically implies a deliberate, often upright torso flexion as a gesture of respect or greeting, not object retrieval. While both involve forward bending, the intent and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0555_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' refers to a specific, rhythmic, dynamic activity involving jumping over a rope. The prediction 'dancing' describes a different category of movement that, while also dynamic, is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of jump roping. Although both are active, they involve distinct motion patterns and intent, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0556_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a dynamic, repetitive cleaning motion typically with a mop. The prediction 'pick up' suggests a brief, discrete action of lifting an object, which may occur before or after mopping but does not represent the core activity itself. While 'pick up' could be a minor preparatory step, it is not a logical temporal part of the main mopping action and lacks the specificity or semantic equivalence required for a higher score."
videos/session_0557_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: salute,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to groom their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'salute' is a distinct gesture involving a single hand raised to the forehead in a formal or military context. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and spatial location, with no meaningful semantic or temporal overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0558_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: lifting,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific type of weight-lifting exercise. The prediction 'lifting' is a semantically related and plausible generalization that captures the core motion of the activity, especially given the low-resolution thermal video context where fine-grained details may be ambiguous. This aligns with the criteria for a high score as it reflects a logical and specific interpretation of the dynamic action."
videos/session_0559_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically holding it and looking at the screen.

The predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture entirely, typically involving an extended index finger. These are distinct manual actions with different semantic meanings and visual forms, even in low-resolution thermal video. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

However, 'pointing' is not a necessary or typical component of this action and suggests a different intent (e.g., directing attention). While there could be rare scenarios where pointing at a stop sign occurs, it is not a standard or semantically equivalent interpretation of 'stopsign', making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0569_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a rhythmic, communicative motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both involve hand movement, they serve different purposes and exhibit opposing motion patterns (inward pull vs. outward wave), making this a largely incorrect match."

Although both involve arm movement, their intent, dynamics, and social context are fundamentally different. This constitutes a completely different action with minimal semantic overlap."
videos/session_0692_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which often involves gestures, facial expressions, or movement while talking. While people may stand during a conversation, the prediction 'Standing' is overly generic and static, failing to capture the core interactive nature of 'conversation'. According to the constraints, generic static descriptions for clearly interactive or dynamic labels should receive a low score."
videos/session_0693_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and not strongly indicative of typical gym-focused activities like weightlifting or cardio machines. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but somewhat generic interpretation."
videos/session_0694_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: dancing,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Dancing' is a valid, specific instance of such self-selected activity, making the prediction correct."

videos/session_0698_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a highly plausible and semantically appropriate posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short and low-resolution ones, distinguishing between lying still and actual sleep is challenging, and lying is a necessary and typical component of sleeping. Therefore, this constitutes a correct interpretation within the context of HAR labeling."
videos/session_0699_dance.mp4,dance,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement typically involving the whole body, while the predicted action 'walking' is a fundamentally different locomotive activity with distinct motion patterns. Although both are dynamic, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor is walking a plausible instantiation of 'dance' in this context."
videos/session_0700_jog.mp4,jog,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jog' refers to a specific, rhythmic, forward-moving physical activity typically performed at a steady pace. The predicted action 'dancing' involves expressive, often non-linear and varied movements that are not semantically equivalent to jogging. While both are dynamic activities, they belong to distinctly different action categories with different intent and motion patterns. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0701_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: push-up,0.0,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'push-up' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while on the ground and does not represent falling or any temporal phase of falling (e.g., stumbling, collapsing). These actions are semantically and physically unrelated."
videos/session_0702_jump.mp4,jump,Action: bow,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement, while the predicted action 'bow' is a forward-bending, static or slow gesture. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0703_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various physical activities. Dancing is a form of physical exercise and falls within the plausible range of actions for a 'gym' context, especially given that 'freestyle' (as noted in constraints) allows for any self-chosen movement. Thus, 'dancing' is a specific, valid instance of the abstract 'gym' label."
videos/session_0704_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: No Action,0.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing any self-chosen active movement, which implies dynamic activity. The prediction 'No Action' directly contradicts this by asserting inactivity, which is incorrect unless the video clearly shows no motion—which is unlikely given the label. This falls under a generic static description for a clearly dynamic label, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0705_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a specific dynamic exercise involving repeated jumping with arm and leg movements. The prediction 'jumping' captures the core motion component of this activity, even if it omits the full form of a jumping jack. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the emphasis on semantic similarity over exact wording, this is a highly plausible and semantically close match."

videos/session_0708_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walk,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walk' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns in thermal video; walking does not reasonably encompass or temporally overlap with turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0709_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: placing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving rhythmic lowering and raising of the body. The predicted action 'placing' suggests a static or manipulative action (e.g., putting an object down), which is semantically unrelated to performing pushups.

videos/session_0710_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Kick,0.6,"A 'legraise' typically involves lifting one or both legs while lying down or seated, often as a core exercise. A 'kick' involves a dynamic leg extension, usually while standing, and is more forceful and momentum-driven. While both involve leg movement, they differ in posture, intent, and execution. However, due to the low-resolution thermal video and potential visual similarity in leg motion, the prediction is related but not fully accurate—warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0711_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion often used for greeting. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context differ significantly. 'Waving' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'airdrum', nor is it a plausible specific instance under an abstract label. Thus, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0712_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Singing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'boxing' is a dynamic, high-intensity activity involving specific upper-body movements, while the predicted action 'Singing' is a completely unrelated vocal activity with no semantic or physical overlap.

videos/session_0720_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Drumming,0.0,"The predicted action 'Drumming' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves cleaning a floor with a mop, typically requiring sweeping or wiping motions, while drumming involves rhythmic striking of a surface, usually with hands or sticks. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0721_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touch head,0.6,"The predicted action 'touch head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks the specificity of hair brushing. While plausible, it could describe many other behaviors (e.g., scratching, adjusting glasses), making it less precise than the ground truth."
videos/session_0722_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: putting on hat,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'putting on hat' involves a completely different motion (reaching upward to place an object on the head) and shares no semantic, functional, or temporal relationship with a bicep curl. This is a clear mismatch."

Drumming involves rhythmic striking of a surface (typically with hands or sticks), while mopping involves cleaning a floor with a mop—these actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and context. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0783_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: salute,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming behavior near the head, typically with repetitive hand-to-hair motion. The predicted action 'salute' is a distinct gesture involving a static or brief hand-to-forehead movement, commonly associated with military or formal contexts. While both involve hand movement near the head, the intent, motion pattern, and semantic meaning are fundamentally different. This constitutes a nearly complete mismatch, warranting a very low score."

videos/session_0955_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific, controlled exercise movement involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'Dancing' describes a broad, rhythmic, and often full-body activity that is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of a legraise. While both are dynamic, dancing does not align with the specific nature of a legraise, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0956_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Saluting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, dynamic arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion. The predicted action 'saluting' is a static or briefly held gesture involving one arm raised to the head, which is visually and semantically distinct from airdrumming. There is no temporal or conceptual overlap between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0957_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, repetitive punching movements typically performed in a fighting stance. The predicted action 'pointing' is a static or minimally dynamic gesture that is semantically unrelated to boxing. It does not represent a temporal phase of boxing, nor is it a plausible specific instance under an abstract label. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0958_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: looking around,0.3,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers to a specific, deliberate lateral or vertical head movement, typically indicating 'no' or 'yes'. The prediction 'looking around' implies eye or head motion scanning the environment, which is semantically related but not equivalent or a temporal part of shaking one's head. While both involve head motion, the intent and pattern differ significantly, making this a partial but insufficient match."
videos/session_0959_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear. The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0960_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they are distinct actions with different physical motions (e.g., bringing a cup to the mouth vs. using utensils or hands to eat). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal part or semantic equivalent, making this a mismatch."
videos/session_0961_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The prediction 'drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0962_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: touching face,0.9,"The predicted action 'touching face' is highly consistent with the ground truth 'wipeface', as wiping one's face inherently involves touching the face. Given the low-resolution thermal video, fine-grained distinctions between 'wiping' and 'touching' may be ambiguous, and 'touching face' captures the core semantic and physical interaction of the intended action."
videos/session_0963_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pickup' typically involves bending down to retrieve an object. The predicted action 'bending' is a core and necessary component of the 'pickup' motion, making it a valid temporal and semantic part of the intended activity."
videos/session_0964_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves a dynamic, rhythmic jumping motion with arm movement to swing a rope. The predicted action 'waving' primarily involves arm movement without the characteristic jumping or full-body coordination of jump roping. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0965_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'handshake' exactly matches the ground truth action 'handshake', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0966_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Dance,0.1,"The ground truth action 'hug' involves close physical contact between individuals, typically static or involving gentle movement toward each other. 'Dance' is a dynamic, rhythmic activity that does not inherently involve hugging and is semantically unrelated to the specific interpersonal interaction described by 'hug'. There is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify considering 'dance' as a valid interpretation of 'hug'."
videos/session_0967_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' is a dynamic, interactive behavior that involves physical contact or forceful motion toward another person. The prediction 'standing' describes a static, non-interactive posture and does not represent any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of pushing someone. Given the clear dynamism implied by 'pushsomeone', a generic static label like 'standing' is incorrect and warrants a low score."
videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: greeting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a clear aggressive or forceful leg movement directed at another person, while the predicted action 'greeting' suggests a friendly social interaction (e.g., waving or nodding). These actions are semantically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or contextual overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies a clear, aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person. The prediction 'pointing' is a fundamentally different gesture—non-aggressive, communicative, and lacking the physical contact or intent of punching. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no temporal or categorical overlap in this context."
videos/session_0970_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: handshake,0.8,"A handshake is a specific form of social interaction that commonly occurs during a conversation. While not identical, it is a plausible and contextually relevant component of the broader 'conversation' activity, especially in thermal video where fine details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and somewhat generic compared to typical gym-related actions like weightlifting or using equipment. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but not strongly indicative action."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. Dancing is a form of physical exercise and falls within the plausible range of actions for a 'gym' context, especially given that 'freestyle' in this setting implies any self-chosen movement. Thus, the prediction is semantically appropriate."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: squat,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. The prediction 'squat' is a specific, valid physical action that falls within the scope of freestyle activity, making it a correct and appropriate match."
videos/session_0974_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Dancing,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, active movement that reasonably falls under the broad interpretation of 'gym'-related activity, especially given that 'freestyle' (as noted in the context) allows for any self-chosen action. Thus, the prediction is semantically appropriate and aligns with the intent of the label."
videos/session_0975_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: walking,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walking' is a valid, specific action that falls under this abstract label, making the prediction correct."
