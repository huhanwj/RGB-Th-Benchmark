videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sitting,1.0,The prediction 'Sitting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sit'.
videos/session_0002_walk.mp4,walk,Action: bending,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' is a dynamic, locomotive activity, while the predicted action 'bending' is a static or stationary movement that does not involve forward motion. Bending is not a temporal part of walking (e.g., it doesn't represent starting, stopping, or transitioning into/out of walking), nor is it semantically equivalent or a plausible sub-component of typical walking behavior in this context. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep', as sleeping typically involves lying down. While not an exact lexical match, it accurately captures the essential physical state associated with sleeping in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: wave,0.3,"The ground truth 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic full-body movement, while the prediction 'wave' is a limited, isolated arm gesture. Although waving can occasionally occur within dancing, it is not representative of the core activity and is too generic and partial to be considered a valid instance or temporal part of 'dance'."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that share visual similarities, especially in low-resolution thermal video where gait speed may be hard to distinguish. However, they are not exact matches nor temporal parts of each other—jogging implies a faster, more dynamic motion than walking. The prediction is plausible but less specific to the ground truth, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: falling,1.0,"The prediction 'falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same event with slightly different phrasing."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement, while the predicted action 'waving' involves arm motion and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between jumping and waving, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a specific dynamic exercise involving jumping with coordinated arm and leg movements. The prediction 'jumping' captures the core dynamic component (jumping) of the jumping jack, even though it omits the full-body coordination. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the emphasis on action similarity over exactness, this is a highly plausible and semantically close match."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: stretching,0.3,"While both 'squat' and 'stretching' are physical activities, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Squatting involves bending the knees and lowering the hips, typically as a strength exercise, whereas stretching focuses on elongating muscles and improving flexibility. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase of squatting nor is it a specific instance of an abstract label that includes squatting. Therefore, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' refers to a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step and bending of the knees. The prediction 'dancing' is a completely different category of activity that does not encompass or logically relate to performing a lunge. While both are dynamic, 'dancing' is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or specific instance of 'lunge', nor is 'lunge' a typical component of general dancing in this context. Therefore, the actions are mismatched."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not inherently involve turning, nor is it a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending' is related to 'pushup' as pushups involve bending at the elbows and lowering the body, but it is less specific and could describe many other actions (e.g., bending forward or picking something up). It captures a component of the motion but not the full, distinctive pattern of a pushup."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'dancing' describes a completely different, broader, and rhythm-based activity that does not align with the targeted motion of a legraise. Although both are dynamic, they belong to distinct action categories with little semantic overlap in this context."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: talking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'talking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. Talking does not constitute a part of airdrumming, nor is it a plausible interpretation of the same visual content."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: throwing,0.9,"The prediction 'throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'boxing', as punching or throwing punches is fundamental to boxing. While not an exact label match, it accurately captures a defining movement of the activity."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, and 'Standing' fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of 'shakehead'."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: talking on mobile phone,1.0,"The predicted action 'talking on mobile phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: talking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'eat' involves consuming food, which typically includes distinct hand-to-mouth motions and engagement with food items. The predicted action 'talking' is a completely different activity that does not overlap temporally or semantically with eating. While talking can sometimes occur while eating, the core actions are unrelated, and there's no indication that 'talking' is a necessary or typical part of the eating process in this context."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The prediction 'drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: talking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'talking' is unrelated in both motion and intent, as talking typically involves mouth movement and vocalization without facial wiping. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down to lift an object, which may include partial forward bending but is functionally distinct from 'bowing', a gesture typically involving a deliberate, respectful forward tilt of the torso without object interaction. While both involve forward motion, the intent and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jump rope,1.0,"The prediction 'jump rope' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumprope', differing only in spacing/formatting."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.6,"Sweeping and mopping the floor are distinct cleaning actions involving different tools and motions; however, they are semantically related as floor-cleaning activities performed in a similar context. While not exact or temporal parts of each other, the prediction shows reasonable contextual alignment, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: talking on phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person grooming their hair, typically with a brush or hand near the head. The predicted action 'talking on phone' describes a completely different activity involving holding a phone to the ear, which shares no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap with brushing hair. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexing the elbow to lift a weight. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the arm and finger in a direction, which is anatomically and functionally distinct from a bicep curl. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, and 'pointing' does not represent a plausible phase or variant of performing a bicep curl."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: use_phone,1.0,"The prediction 'use_phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the act of interacting with a mobile phone."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: speaking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, while the predicted action 'speaking' is a completely different activity with distinct motion patterns and intent. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which involves fine hand/finger movements and is typically performed while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture, not the specific action of typing. While sitting may be the posture during typing, it does not capture the actual activity indicated by the label 'type'. Therefore, the prediction is too generic and misses the core action, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs-up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs-up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in hyphenation and pluralization, which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (thumb and index finger touching in a circle), which is a specific hand signal. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a finger to indicate direction or object, which is a distinctly different hand gesture with different intent and form. The two actions are not temporally related, semantically equivalent, or part of the same broader category, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: making a peace sign,1.0,"Making a 'peace sign' is semantically equivalent to 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly associated with the V-sign. The prediction accurately captures the intended action."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction, likely involving deliberate tracing or gesturing. The predicted action 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not capture the circular, continuous motion required by the ground truth. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, with 'pointing' lacking the rotational component essential to 'drawcircleclockwise'."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically side-to-side or up-and-down—and does not capture the circular, directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person interacting with or holding a stop sign, likely as part of a traffic-related gesture or instruction. The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different gesture with distinct intent and motion. There is no semantic equivalence, temporal relationship, or contextual overlap between waving and signaling with a stop sign."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of drawing one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the hand outward in a directional gesture, which is both spatially and functionally opposite to 'pulling in'. There is no significant semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or pushing someone's hand away. The predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct hand gesture with a different intent and motion pattern. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, and 'pointing' is not a temporal phase or valid variant of 'pushhandaway'."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same specific gesture."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: clapping,0.0,"The predicted action 'clapping' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'sweep'. Sweeping involves repetitive arm movements with a broom or similar tool to clean a surface, while clapping involves striking hands together, typically as a gesture of approval or rhythm. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'pointing' is a static, gestural action with no meaningful overlap in motion semantics or intent. The two actions are fundamentally different in nature and context."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The predicted action 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or tracing shapes. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no clear temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position or direction. The predicted action 'turning' is related, as turning can be part of a dodging motion, but it is less specific and may not fully capture the evasive intent or dynamic nature of dodging. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' is a specific, dynamic activity involving arm motion and body coordination to roll a ball toward pins. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no meaningful overlap or temporal relationship to bowling. Walking is not a preparatory, intermediate, or concluding phase of bowling in a way that would justify partial credit, especially given the specificity of the 'bowling' label."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'pointing', which typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger. While not an exact match, pointing is a specific and plausible instance of lifting a hand, especially in a thermal video where fine gestures may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is considered highly consistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, deliberate contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a broader, rhythmic hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and context, with no clear temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, commonly used in touchscreen interactions or fine motor tasks. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a single finger to indicate direction or object, which is a distinctly different hand movement with different intent and form. While both involve hand actions, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or subsumed under a broader abstract category that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand/arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically precede/overlap with the act of drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'drinking' involves a deliberate hand-to-mouth motion with a container. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct, with no temporal or semantic overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0050_cough.mp4,cough,Action: talking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'talking' involves vocalization and different mouth/throat movements. Although both involve the upper body and may occur in similar postures, they are distinct actions with different physiological mechanisms. There is no strong semantic or temporal relationship between coughing and talking in this context, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"'Stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury, whereas 'walking' suggests a steady, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, the manner and stability differ significantly. The prediction misses the key characteristic of the ground truth action and is therefore only loosely related."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion with an object.

videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: singing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a specific, localized hand-to-face gesture typically associated with using a tissue or hand to clear the nose. The predicted action 'singing' is a completely different activity involving vocalization and often open mouth posture, with no meaningful overlap in motion, intent, or body mechanics. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual similarity between the two actions."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: arm raise,0.9,"The predicted action 'arm raise' is a specific and valid movement that falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself', as raising one's arms is a common and integral part of stretching routines."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Singing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their face, which is a specific and localized gesture.

videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: greeting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' involves physical contact or forceful interaction, while the predicted action 'greeting' typically implies a friendly, non-forceful social gesture (e.g., waving or shaking hands). These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no significant overlap in intent or motion dynamics."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies an aggressive, directed kicking motion toward another person. The prediction 'dancing' describes a rhythmic, expressive movement that is generally non-aggressive and not targeted at another individual. While both involve leg motion, the intent, context, and nature of the actions are fundamentally different, making this a low-similarity mismatch."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: handshake,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion toward another person, while the predicted action 'handshake' is a friendly, consensual gesture.

videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a core and necessary component of the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short ones, it is common to capture the static posture associated with sleeping rather than the full physiological state. Since lying down is the typical and expected physical manifestation of sleeping in such contexts, this constitutes a semantically equivalent and temporally valid representation."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: stretching,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement typically involving the whole body. 'Stretching' is a static or slow-moving activity focused on flexibility and is not a typical component or semantic equivalent of dancing. While both are physical activities, they belong to different action categories, and stretching does not reasonably fall under the expected movements for 'dance' in this context."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jog' is a dynamic, locomotive activity involving rhythmic running at a slow pace. The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to jogging. There is no overlap in motion pattern, intent, or category, making this a clear mismatch."

The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential action of typing. While sitting may be the physical posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual activity, especially since 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0091_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is raised, while the predicted action 'waving' involves a different hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These are distinct gestures with different intents and visual patterns, even in thermal video. Although both involve hand movement, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or plausible variants under the given constraints."
videos/session_0092_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0093_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which involves a specific hand configuration (thumb and forefinger touching to form a circle). The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different hand movement involving motion to greet or signal, with no overlap in gesture or intent. There is no temporal or semantic similarity between the two actions."
videos/session_0094_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: stop,0.1,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (forming a 'V' with fingers), while the predicted action 'stop' typically corresponds to an open-palm gesture used to signal halting. These are distinct hand signals with different meanings and visual forms, even in low-resolution thermal video. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0095_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Saluting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific hand or arm motion tracing a clockwise circle, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'Saluting' involves a static or brief upward gesture to the forehead, which is anatomically and semantically unrelated to circular drawing motions. There is no temporal, functional, or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0096_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction, likely performed deliberately (e.g., tracing a circle). The predicted action 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would make 'pointing' a valid part or equivalent of drawing a counterclockwise circle."
videos/session_0097_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: raising hand,0.2,"The ground truth 'stopsign' implies the person is mimicking or interacting with a stop sign, which typically involves standing still with one hand raised in a halting gesture. While 'raising hand' partially aligns with this (as a stop sign gesture often includes a raised hand), it misses the specific context and intent of signaling 'stop'. However, given the thermal, low-resolution nature of the video, a partial match is plausible. Still, 'raising hand' alone is too generic and could correspond to many unrelated actions (e.g., waving, asking a question), so it only warrants a low score."
videos/session_0098_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of drawing or pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the hand outward, which is directionally and functionally opposite. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0099_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or warding off with the hand, while the predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct hand gesture with a different intent and motion pattern. The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same action category, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: pointing,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'pointing' involve arm movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. Pointing typically involves a static or directed gesture with a finger, whereas handwaving is a repetitive, broad motion of the hand for greeting or signaling. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase or valid variant of handwaving, nor is it a plausible abstraction of the ground truth."
videos/session_0101_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: waving,0.3,"While both 'clap' and 'waving' involve hand movements, they are distinct actions with different motion patterns and intent. Clapping involves hands moving toward each other to make contact, whereas waving typically involves a single hand moving side-to-side or up-and-down in greeting. The actions are not temporal parts of each other nor semantically equivalent, but they are loosely related as upper-body gestures, warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, full-body movement involving motion along a surface (e.g., sliding down a slide or sliding on the floor). The predicted action 'pointing' is a static, upper-body gesture that is semantically unrelated to sliding. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between pointing and sliding, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The predicted action 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or creating a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and movement patterns, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden shifts in position. The predicted action 'walking' is a slow, steady, and non-evasive locomotion that does not capture the dynamic or reactive nature of dodging. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0106_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The predicted action 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves the act of throwing a ball. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video, the VLM correctly identified the key motion, making this a semantically valid and temporally appropriate match."
videos/session_0107_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Saluting,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'saluting', which specifically involves raising one hand to the forehead in a gesture of respect or acknowledgment. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, the VLM's prediction captures the essential motion and intent of the action, making it a highly plausible and specific match."
videos/session_0108_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a broader, sweeping hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and context, making them semantically distinct with minimal overlap."
videos/session_0109_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, likely related to fine motor manipulation. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a finger to indicate direction or object, which is a different hand configuration and intent. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and kinematically distinct with little overlap in form or function."
videos/session_0110_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, controlled hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely while stationary. The prediction 'waving' involves a different, rhythmic back-and-forth arm motion with no relation to drawing shapes. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Sneezing,1.0,"The prediction 'Sneezing' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sneeze', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."

There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between coughing and drinking in this context."
videos/session_0113_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: bending,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait or movement, often associated with difficulty walking or loss of balance. The predicted action 'bending' refers to a controlled, static or semi-static posture change, typically involving the torso or knees, and does not capture the dynamic, unstable motion characteristic of staggering. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in meaning or temporal relationship."
videos/session_0114_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion with an object. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them equivalent or related."
videos/session_0115_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies bringing a container to the mouth to consume liquid—this is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of or equivalent to blowing one's nose."
videos/session_0116_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: stretching,1.0,"The prediction 'stretching' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth action 'stretchoneself', as both describe the same physical activity of elongating or extending the body."
videos/session_0117_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Talking on the phone,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or face but not necessarily touching the face itself. Although there may be superficial visual similarity in thermal video (e.g., hand near head), the actions are semantically distinct and not temporally or categorically related under the given constraints."

These actions differ significantly in intent, dynamics, and physical manifestation, making them semantically and behaviorally distinct."
videos/session_0121_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: dance,0.2,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a specific aggressive or forceful leg movement directed at another person. The prediction 'dance' is a completely different activity, typically non-aggressive and expressive, with no inherent implication of kicking someone. While dancing may involve kicking motions, without explicit context linking it to an interpersonal kick, it is not a semantically equivalent or temporally related part of 'kicksomeone'. Therefore, the actions are fundamentally dissimilar."
videos/session_0122_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: handshake,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion toward another person, while the predicted action 'handshake' is a friendly, consensual social gesture. Despite both involving arm movement and interpersonal interaction, the intent, dynamics, and semantics are fundamentally different. This constitutes a completely different action under the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0123_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: handshake,0.6,"A 'handshake' is a specific form of social interaction that can occur during a 'conversation', making it contextually related. However, 'conversation' typically implies verbal exchange, which may or may not include a handshake. While the actions are not equivalent, they co-occur frequently enough to be considered plausibly related but not fully aligned."

videos/session_0126_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. This is a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible interpretation given the low-resolution thermal video context."
videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short ones, it is common to capture someone lying down as part of the sleeping activity, even if the person is not actively asleep. This matches the expectation for temporal partiality and contextual interpretation."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: dancing,1.0,"The predicted action 'dancing' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth 'dance', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Dance,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jog' refers to a specific, rhythmic, forward-moving physical activity typically performed at a steady pace. The prediction 'Dance' describes a different category of movement that is generally more varied, expressive, and not necessarily locomotive in the same linear, repetitive manner as jogging. While both are dynamic activities, they are semantically distinct and not temporal parts or equivalents of each other. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0130_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Sitting down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies an uncontrolled, sudden collapse to the ground, typically involving loss of balance or support. In contrast, 'sitting down' is a controlled, deliberate movement. While both involve lowering the body, they are semantically and physically distinct in intent, dynamics, and execution. Therefore, the prediction does not match the ground truth action or its plausible temporal parts."
videos/session_0131_jump.mp4,jump,Action: dancing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a specific, dynamic movement involving propulsion off the ground. 'Dancing' is a broad category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent or a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the clip shows dance-specific movements, this prediction is too divergent from the specific GT action to warrant a higher score."
videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a dynamic, full-body exercise involving repeated jumping with arm and leg movements. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture with no motion, which is inconsistent with the energetic and repetitive nature of jumping jacks. According to the evaluation criteria, assigning a generic static label to a clearly dynamic action warrants a low score."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a dynamic, lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically from a standing position down toward a seated posture and back up. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static, upright posture with no movement. While standing may be part of the starting or ending pose of a squat, the predicted label fails to capture any aspect of the actual movement or intent of the action. Given that 'squat' is a specific, active motion and the prediction is a generic static state, this constitutes a significant mismatch."
videos/session_0134_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, which is distinct from 'walking'. Although both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static-dynamic hybrid nature and intent of a lunge, making it a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0135_turn.mp4,turn,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a dynamic rotational movement, while the predicted action 'standing' describes a static posture with no indication of turning or rotation. This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score criteria."

videos/session_0137_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'dancing' describes a completely different category of activity that does not align with the targeted, isolated movement of a legraise. While both are dynamic, dancing is not a plausible temporal part, semantic equivalent, or specific instance of 'legraise', warranting a low score."
videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements near a drum kit or in the air. The predicted action 'waving' involves moving the hand back and forth in greeting or signaling, which is a different motion pattern and intent.

The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0142_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Taking a photograph,0.0,"The predicted action 'Taking a photograph' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'eat'. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between eating and taking a photograph, and the prediction does not represent a plausible part or variant of the eating activity."

videos/session_0144_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: touching face,0.9,"The predicted action 'touching face' is highly consistent with the ground truth 'wipeface', as wiping one's face inherently involves touching or making contact with the face. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, fine-grained distinctions between 'wiping' and 'touching' may be ambiguous, and 'touching face' reasonably captures the core behavior."
videos/session_0145_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bow,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down to lift an object, which may include a partial bowing motion, but 'bow' typically implies a deliberate, respectful gesture rather than an object retrieval action. The two actions are semantically distinct and not temporal parts of each other; thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0146_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' refers to a specific, rhythmic, dynamic activity involving jumping over a rope. The prediction 'dancing' is a different category of movement that, while also dynamic, does not correspond to the mechanics or intent of jump roping. Although both are active, they are semantically distinct actions with different motion patterns, and 'dancing' is not a temporal part or valid instance of 'jumprope'."
videos/session_0147_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.6,"Sweeping and mopping the floor are distinct cleaning actions involving different tools and motions; however, they are semantically related as floor-cleaning activities performed in a similar context. While not exact or temporal parts of each other, the prediction shows reasonable contextual alignment, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0148_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.6,"The predicted action 'touching head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks specificity. Brushing hair implies a repeated, grooming motion, whereas 'touching head' could be incidental or brief. This is a plausible but less precise interpretation, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0149_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: gesturing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repetitive elbow flexion. The prediction 'gesturing' implies casual or communicative hand/arm movements, which are fundamentally different in intent, form, and dynamics from a bicep curl. While both involve arm motion, 'gesturing' is too generic and unrelated to the targeted muscle movement of a bicep curl, falling into the low-score category."

videos/session_0151_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a distinctly different activity involving holding a cup or bottle and consuming liquid. While both may involve hand-to-mouth motion, the context, intent, and typical posture differ significantly. Given the specificity of 'brushteeth' as a labeled activity, 'Drinking' is a clearly incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0152_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'type', which refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device. The predicted action 'sitting' is a static posture that may accompany typing but does not capture the essential action of typing itself. Since 'sitting' is generic and fails to reflect the specific, active behavior implied by 'type', it is considered a completely different action in this context."

There is no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0173_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: singing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary reflex involving a sudden expulsion of air, while the predicted action 'singing' is a voluntary, sustained vocal activity. These actions are physiologically and behaviorally distinct with no meaningful semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0174_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of coughing. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, and 'standing' fails to capture the essential nature of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0175_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the predicted action 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the key characteristic of instability inherent to 'staggering,' making it a significantly different action rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0176_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different activity involving consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0177_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct and specific upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'drinking' involves bringing a container to the mouth and consuming liquid—this is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of or equivalent to blowing one's nose."
videos/session_0178_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: dancing,0.6,"The ground truth 'stretchoneself' refers to deliberate stretching movements, while the prediction 'dancing' implies rhythmic or expressive motion. Although both are dynamic and may involve similar body motions (e.g., arm or leg movements), dancing is not a direct temporal part or semantic equivalent of stretching. However, they are related in that both are forms of physical activity involving full-body movement, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0179_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: speaking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their face, which is a specific and localized gesture. The predicted action 'speaking' is a completely different activity that does not inherently involve touching the face. While speaking might occasionally coincide with incidental face touching, it is not a logical temporal part, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of 'touchface'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0181_hug.mp4,hug,Action: dancing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'hug' involves close physical contact between individuals, typically with arms around each other. The predicted action 'dancing' is a completely different activity that does not inherently involve hugging and is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of hugging. While both may occur in social settings, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns and intents."
videos/session_0182_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a clear physical interaction involving force applied to another person. The predicted action 'pointing' is a gestural, non-contact behavior that does not involve pushing or any form of physical contact. These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0183_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: knee lift,0.6,"The predicted action 'knee lift' is a plausible component or precursor to 'kicksomeone', as lifting the knee is often part of the motion involved in kicking. However, 'knee lift' alone is more ambiguous and less specific than an actual kick, and may also occur in non-aggressive contexts (e.g., exercise). Thus, it is related but not fully equivalent."
videos/session_0184_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: greeting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion directed at another person, while the predicted action 'greeting' suggests a friendly, non-aggressive social interaction. These actions are semantically and behaviorally opposite in intent and execution, even considering partial or ambiguous visual cues in thermal video. There is no plausible temporal or contextual overlap that would make 'greeting' a valid interpretation of 'punchsomeone'."
videos/session_0185_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which typically involves gestures, facial expressions, or movement between people. While 'standing' could be a static posture during a conversation, it is overly generic and fails to capture the essential interactive nature of 'conversation'. Given the constraints, a generic static description like 'standing' for a socially dynamic label such as 'conversation' warrants a low score."

videos/session_0187_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' is a specific, rhythmic locomotive activity, while 'dancing' typically involves more varied, expressive, and non-locomotive movements. Although both are dynamic and involve leg motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Dancing is not a temporal part of walking, nor is it a plausible interpretation of a walking clip, leading to a low score."

videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially at transition speeds. However, jogging implies a faster, more dynamic gait than walking. While not an exact match or a direct temporal phase (e.g., starting or stopping to jog), the actions are sufficiently similar in intent and form to warrant a medium score."
videos/session_0192_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: lying on the mat,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' implies a person transitioning from an upright position to lying on the ground. The prediction 'lying on the mat' represents the likely end state of a fall, which is a valid temporal part of the 'falldown' action. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of the label, this constitutes a semantically appropriate match."
videos/session_0193_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Dancing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a specific, dynamic movement involving propulsion off the ground. 'Dancing' is a broad category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent nor a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the clip shows dance-specific motions, this prediction is only loosely related and overly generic for a precise label like 'jump'."
videos/session_0194_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: dancing,0.6,"While 'jumpingjack' is a specific, dynamic calisthenic exercise, 'dancing' is a different category of movement. However, both involve rhythmic, full-body motion and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the model cannot discern precise limb coordination. The prediction is not an exact or temporal match, but it is a related dynamic activity, warranting a medium score."

videos/session_0196_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Lunging,1.0,"The prediction 'Lunging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'lunge', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund). This constitutes an exact match in meaning."
videos/session_0197_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walk,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walk' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0198_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending down,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending down' is related to 'pushup' as pushups involve bending the elbows and lowering the body, which may appear as 'bending down' in a low-resolution thermal video. However, 'bending down' is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., picking something up), so it doesn't fully capture the distinct repetitive upper-body motion characteristic of a pushup."
videos/session_0199_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no meaningful overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body mechanics. There is no temporal or semantic relationship between walking and performing a legraise."
videos/session_0200_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: phone_call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'phone_call' implies holding a phone to the ear, which involves a distinctly different posture and motion pattern. These actions are semantically and kinematically unrelated, with no temporal or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0201_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, aggressive arm movements in a combative or training context, while the predicted action 'waving' is a benign, communicative gesture with different motion patterns and intent. Although both involve arm motion, they are semantically and functionally distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."

There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0207_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bow,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down to lift an object, which may include a brief forward bend but is functionally distinct from 'bow', which typically implies a deliberate, often upright-leaning or ceremonial gesture without object interaction. While both involve some forward trunk movement, 'bow' does not capture the object-interaction or purposeful reaching/grasping component central to 'pickup'. Thus, the actions are semantically different."
videos/session_0208_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a specific, dynamic activity involving rhythmic jumping with a rope. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but lacks the characteristic vertical bouncing motion and coordination with a rope. These actions are visually and semantically distinct in thermal video, and 'waving' is not a temporal phase or valid variant of 'jumprope'."
videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are highly similar cleaning actions that involve comparable body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). While not identical, they are semantically close enough in the context of low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained tool distinction may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is considered nearly equivalent."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: adjusting hair,0.9,"The predicted action 'adjusting hair' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'brushhair', as both involve actively manipulating or grooming one's hair. While not an exact lexical match, the actions are functionally equivalent in the context of human activity recognition from thermal video, where fine-grained distinctions (e.g., using a brush vs. hands) may not be visually discernible."
videos/session_0211_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving elbow flexion, typically with weights. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and context—it is a communicative gesture rather than a resistance exercise. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0212_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically while holding it and looking at the screen. The predicted action 'eating' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap.

videos/session_0213_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are not sufficiently overlapping to be considered related or temporally partial. Thus, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0214_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to typing on a keyboard or similar activity, which involves fine hand/finger movements typically while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing behavior. While sitting may be a common posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the specific active component (typing) implied by the label. Thus, the prediction is incorrect."

Although both involve hand motion, they are semantically and functionally distinct gestures with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0218_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the index and middle fingers in a V shape), while the predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a single finger to indicate direction or object. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct gestures with different intentions and visual forms. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase or valid variant of making a victory sign, nor is it a plausible abstraction of it."

videos/session_0220_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically side-to-side or up-and-down—and does not capture the circular, directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0221_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is interacting with or responding to a stop sign, likely by stopping or signaling. The prediction 'pointing' does not align with this context unless explicitly shown as pointing at a stop sign, which is not indicated. These are semantically distinct actions with low overlap."
videos/session_0222_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of drawing one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The prediction 'wave' involves moving the hand outward and back in a greeting or signaling motion, which is directionally and functionally different. While both involve hand movement, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, or valid instances under an abstract label. Thus, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0223_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or pushing someone's hand away. The predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct hand gesture with a different intent and motion pattern. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, and 'pointing' does not represent a temporal phase or valid variant of 'pushhandaway'."

Although dancing may sometimes include clapping, the prediction does not reflect the specific action shown in the clip and is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'clap'. Therefore, it is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0227_slide.mp4,slide,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' involves a smooth, continuous motion typically along a surface (e.g., sliding down a slide or sliding on the floor), whereas the predicted action 'waving' is an arm gesture with no meaningful overlap in motion pattern, intent, or physical execution. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0232_tap.mp4,tap,Action: touching chest,0.9,"The ground truth action 'tap' typically involves a light touch, often on the chest or another body part. The prediction 'touching chest' is a specific and plausible instance of tapping, especially in a thermal video where fine motion details may be ambiguous. Given the context and the allowance for semantic similarity, this is a strong match."
videos/session_0233_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching, likely a specific hand movement.

videos/session_0273_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: gesturing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repetitive elbow flexion. The prediction 'gesturing' implies casual or communicative hand/arm movements, which are fundamentally different in intent, form, and dynamics from a bicep curl. While both involve arm motion, 'gesturing' lacks the resistance, repetition, and biomechanics characteristic of a bicep curl, making it a mismatch rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0274_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."

videos/session_0281_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: clap,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific hand or arm motion tracing a clockwise circle, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'clap' involves bringing hands together rapidly, which is a fundamentally different movement with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no reasonable interpretation under which clapping constitutes drawing a circle clockwise, even considering partial or abstract interpretations."
videos/session_0282_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular movement and is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of drawing a circle.

The prediction 'pointing' is a generic gesture that could be unrelated to a stop sign; without explicit reference to a stop sign or traffic context, it is too vague and potentially unrelated. Thus, it constitutes a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0284_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of drawing one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The prediction 'waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a greeting or signaling motion, which is directionally and functionally different.

videos/session_0292_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up,0.6,"The predicted action 'Picking up' is related to bowling, as it could refer to picking up a bowling ball, which is a plausible part of the bowling sequence. However, it is less specific and does not fully capture the core activity of bowling (e.g., throwing or rolling the ball). Thus, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0293_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'pointing', as pointing typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this is a reasonable and specific interpretation of the same underlying gesture."
videos/session_0294_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a broader, sweeping hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in intent or movement pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0315_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially at transition speeds. However, jogging implies a faster, more dynamic gait than walking. While not an exact match or a direct temporal phase of 'jog', the prediction is reasonably close in semantics and motion pattern, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0316_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: crawling,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden loss of balance and collapse to the ground, typically involving a rapid, uncontrolled motion. 'Crawling' is a controlled, deliberate movement on hands and knees, which is semantically and physically distinct from falling. While both involve proximity to the ground, crawling does not represent a temporal phase or variant of falling, nor is it a plausible misinterpretation under the constraints of thermal video. Therefore, the actions are fundamentally different."

videos/session_0342_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (forming a 'V' with fingers), while the predicted action 'waving' describes a different, broader hand movement. Although both involve hand motion, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and visual forms. The prediction does not capture the specific nature of the victory sign, nor is waving a logical temporal part or equivalent of making a victory sign."
videos/session_0343_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically side-to-side or up-and-down—and does not resemble the precise, circular trajectory required by the ground truth. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0344_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The predicted action 'pointing' is a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically unrelated to drawing circles. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would make pointing a valid part of drawing a counter-clockwise circle."
videos/session_0345_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not align with the specific intent or object interaction implied by 'stopsign'. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different purposes, making this a low-score mismatch."
videos/session_0346_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of drawing or pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the hand outward, which is directionally and functionally opposite. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0347_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a friendly or gestural motion typically involving side-to-side or up-and-down movement of the hand without contact or resistance. The two actions differ significantly in intent, motion dynamics, and physical interaction, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0348_sit.mp4,sit,Action: squat,0.6,"While 'squat' is not an exact match for 'sit', it is a related lower-body posture that can be contextually associated with sitting, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine distinctions may be ambiguous. However, squatting is a distinct action involving bent knees and a lowered torso without necessarily contacting a surface, whereas 'sit' typically implies resting on a surface. Given the temporal partiality allowance, this is not a direct temporal phase of sitting (like 'sitting down'), but the actions are sufficiently similar in pose to warrant a medium score."

videos/session_0351_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a core and necessary component of the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially low-resolution ones, distinguishing between lying still (as in sleeping) and other forms of lying may be difficult. Since sleeping typically involves lying down, and no contradictory motion is implied, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid interpretation."

videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially at transition speeds. However, jogging implies a faster, more dynamic gait than walking. While not an exact match or a direct temporal part (e.g., starting or stopping to jog), the actions are semantically close enough to warrant a medium score."
videos/session_0354_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sit_up,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden, uncontrolled collapse or loss of balance, whereas the predicted action 'sit_up' is a controlled, deliberate core exercise typically performed from a lying position. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion dynamics, and posture, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0355_jump.mp4,jump,Action: dance,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a specific, dynamic movement involving propulsion off the ground. The predicted action 'dance' is a broader category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent or a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the clip shows dancing (which encompasses varied movements), predicting 'dance' for a 'jump' label is too divergent and overly general, falling into a low-score mismatch."
videos/session_0356_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: dancing,0.6,"Jumping jacks and dancing are both dynamic, full-body movements often performed in exercise or freestyle contexts. While not semantically equivalent, they share kinematic similarities (rhythmic, repetitive motion involving arms and legs). However, 'dancing' is not a specific instance or temporal part of 'jumpingjack', placing it in the medium-similarity range."
videos/session_0357_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a specific, dynamic lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips. The predicted action 'Dancing' is a completely different category of movement that typically involves rhythmic, full-body motion and does not encompass squatting as a core or typical component.

While both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static-dynamic hybrid nature and form of a lunge, making it a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0359_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

The prediction 'dancing' describes a completely different, broader, and unrelated dynamic activity. While both are active movements, 'dancing' does not capture or closely relate to the specific motion of a leg raise, nor is it a plausible temporal segment or semantic equivalent. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

The prediction 'Dancing' describes a fundamentally different activity with distinct motion patterns and intent. While both are dynamic, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or subsumed under a shared abstract category in this context. Therefore, the prediction is considered a completely different action."

There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0369_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bend,0.9,"The predicted action 'bend' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking up an object typically involves bending down. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action, even if not the full sequence."
videos/session_0370_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' inherently involves jumping. While 'jumping' is slightly less specific than 'jumprope', it accurately captures the core dynamic motion present in the activity, especially given the constraints of a low-resolution thermal video where rope details may be indiscernible. Thus, the prediction is semantically aligned and temporally valid."
videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.6,"Sweeping and mopping the floor are distinct cleaning actions involving different tools and motions; however, they are semantically related as floor-cleaning activities performed in a similar context.

videos/session_0373_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving elbow flexion, typically with weights. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and context—it is a communicative gesture rather than a resistance exercise.

videos/session_0376_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'type', which implies typing on a keyboard or similar fine motor activity, typically performed while seated but distinct from the general posture of 'sitting'. The prediction 'Sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the specific action of typing. Since 'sitting' could occur without any typing, and the core activity (typing) is missing from the prediction, this is a mismatch."

Clapping involves hands moving toward each other to make contact, whereas waving typically involves a side-to-side or up-and-down motion of one or both hands without contact. The prediction is not a temporal part of clapping nor a semantic equivalent, but it is loosely related as a hand gesture, warranting a low but non-zero score."

The prediction 'standing' describes a static, upright posture with no movement, which does not capture any temporal phase of a lunge (e.g., lowering into the lunge, returning to stand). Given the dynamic nature of 'lunge', a generic static description like 'standing' is insufficient and misrepresents the activity."

The predicted action 'push-up' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while on the ground, involving upper body movement. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and physical posture. A push-up does not represent any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of falling down, nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract labeling. Therefore, the prediction is completely mismatched."
videos/session_0450_jump.mp4,jump,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement, while the predicted action 'throwing' involves a different motion pattern focused on arm movement and object propulsion.

videos/session_0451_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: dancing,0.6,"While 'jumping jack' and 'dancing' are both dynamic, full-body movements often performed in exercise or freestyle contexts, they are not semantically equivalent. However, in low-resolution thermal video, the motion patterns of jumping jacks could be misinterpreted as dance-like movement, especially if the person's limbs are moving rhythmically. Given that 'dancing' is a plausible but less specific interpretation of a dynamic, repetitive action, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0452_squat.mp4,squat,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' involves a distinct bending motion at the knees, typically with hips lowering toward the ground. The predicted action 'throwing' involves arm motion and propulsion of an object, which is biomechanically and semantically unrelated to squatting.

The predicted action 'pointing' is a different gesture with a distinct intent and motion pattern. While both involve arm/hand movement, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, and 'pointing' does not represent a temporal phase or valid variant of 'drawzigzag'."
videos/session_0485_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position or direction. The prediction 'turning' is related, as turning can be part of a dodging motion, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the evasive intent or dynamic nature of dodging.

videos/session_0491_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: touching face,0.3,"While touching the face can occur during a sneeze (e.g., covering the mouth/nose), it is not sufficient on its own to indicate sneezing. 'Touching face' is a generic action that could relate to many behaviors (itching, adjusting glasses, etc.), and does not capture the distinctive, forceful, and transient nature of a sneeze. Therefore, the prediction is only weakly related and lacks the specificity or contextual cues needed to be considered a correct interpretation of the ground truth 'sneeze'."

These are distinct actions with different hand trajectories and purposes. Although both may involve bringing an object or hand near the mouth, drinking is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of 'touchface'."
videos/session_0498_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short ones, it is common to capture the static pose associated with sleeping rather than the act of falling asleep itself. Since lying down is the typical physical state during sleep, this constitutes a correct and contextually appropriate prediction."

videos/session_0504_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies a social interaction typically involving speaking and listening, possibly with gesturing. While 'pointing' can occur during a conversation as a gesture, it is not sufficient on its own to represent the core activity of conversing. Pointing is more specific and could occur in non-conversational contexts (e.g., giving directions alone). Thus, the prediction captures a possible element but misses the primary intent of the label, warranting a low-to-mid score; however, given the lack of clear evidence that pointing is part of an ongoing dialogue in the thermal clip, it leans toward a low score."

videos/session_0506_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves bending down to lift an object, which may include partial forward bending but is functionally distinct from 'bowing', a gesture typically involving a deliberate, respectful forward tilt of the torso without object interaction. While both involve forward trunk motion, the intent and context differ significantly; 'bowing' does not imply object manipulation and is not a logical temporal phase of 'pickup'. Thus, the actions are semantically dissimilar."
videos/session_0507_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: salute,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely in a defensive or gestural context.

videos/session_0508_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: salute,0.6,"Both 'handwave' and 'salute' involve raising a hand in a deliberate gesture, making them semantically related upper-body actions. However, they are distinct social signals with different intent and motion patterns—waving typically involves lateral or repeated motion, while saluting is a static or single upward gesture held briefly. Given the similarity in body part used and intentional nature, but clear difference in action semantics, this falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0509_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0511_slide.mp4,slide,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or prone position (e.g., on a slide or floor). The predicted action 'waving' involves arm motion and is semantically unrelated to sliding. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between waving and sliding, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0512_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific, controlled hand or body motion creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor movement. The predicted action 'waving' is a broad, rhythmic arm motion that does not resemble or logically relate to drawing a zigzag shape. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0513_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, typically involving lateral or sudden body motion to avoid something. The predicted action 'wave' is a deliberate, rhythmic arm movement used for greeting or signaling, which is semantically and kinematically unrelated to dodging.

Standing is not a temporal part of coughing, nor is it semantically related; it is a generic static state that fails to capture the essential nature of the labeled action."
videos/session_0521_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the predicted action 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the key characteristic of instability inherent to 'staggering'. The prediction is related but misses the defining quality of the ground truth, placing it in the low-to-mid range; however, given the distinct nature of stagger vs. regular walking, it leans toward a low score."
videos/session_0522_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: talking,0.1,"Yawning and talking are distinct actions with different physical manifestations in thermal video. While both involve mouth movement, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or plausible variants of each other. The prediction does not align with the ground truth action."
videos/session_0523_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct and specific upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is visually and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions, and neither is a plausible part or abstraction of the other."

videos/session_0532_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which typically involves gestures, facial expressions, or movement between people. While 'standing' could be a posture during conversation, it is overly generic and static; it fails to capture the essential interactive nature of 'conversation'. According to the constraints, generic static descriptions for clearly interactive or dynamic labels should receive a low score unless inactivity is evident—which is not indicated here."

videos/session_0536_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short ones, the model may not observe full sleep behavior but rather the characteristic static pose of lying down, which is a necessary and typical component of sleeping. Thus, this constitutes a correct interpretation within the context of temporal partiality."

videos/session_0538_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walk,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially at transition speeds. While not exact matches, they share significant semantic and kinematic overlap. However, jogging typically implies a faster pace and more dynamic motion than walking, so the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."

The predicted action 'drink' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. These actions are not semantically related, temporally connected, or contextually overlapping in typical human behavior, especially in a thermal video setting where fine-grained object use (like a cup) is unlikely to be discernible. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0693_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, active movement that reasonably falls under the broad interpretation of 'gym' in this context, especially since 'freestyle' (as noted in constraints) allows for any self-chosen action. Thus, the prediction is semantically appropriate."
videos/session_0694_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: dancing,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. Dancing is a valid and specific instance of such self-selected activity, making the prediction fully consistent with the abstract label."

videos/session_0700_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically close and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, jogging typically implies a faster, more dynamic gait than walking, so the prediction is plausible but not fully accurate."
videos/session_0701_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: push-up,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'push-up' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while on the ground, involving upper body movement. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and physical posture. A push-up does not represent a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of a fall. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0702_jump.mp4,jump,Action: drumming,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement, while the predicted action 'drumming' involves rhythmic hand or arm movements typically while seated or stationary.

videos/session_0704_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: No Action,0.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing an arbitrary, self-chosen action, which implies observable movement or activity. The prediction 'No Action' contradicts this by asserting inactivity, which is inconsistent with the dynamic nature of the 'freestyle' label. This falls under the low-score category for assigning a generic static description to a clearly dynamic abstract label."
videos/session_0705_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: dancing,0.6,"While 'jumpingjack' is a specific, dynamic calisthenic exercise, 'dancing' is a different category of rhythmic movement. However, both involve full-body motion and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion pattern is ambiguous.

videos/session_0719_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Juggling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves a specific, rhythmic jumping motion with a rope, while the predicted action 'juggling' refers to tossing and catching multiple objects—typically with the hands—and does not involve jumping or a rope. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct, especially in thermal video where motion patterns differ significantly. This is a clear mismatch with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0720_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: drumming,0.0,"The predicted action 'drumming' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Drumming involves rhythmic striking of surfaces (typically with hands or sticks), while mopping involves cleaning a floor with a mop—actions that differ significantly in intent, motion, and object interaction. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two."
videos/session_0721_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: saluting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to groom their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'saluting' is a distinct gesture involving a rigid hand-to-forehead motion, commonly associated with military protocol. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and context, with no meaningful semantic or temporal overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0722_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: pick up,0.6,"The ground truth 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving lifting a weight toward the shoulder. The prediction 'pick up' is related in that it involves lifting, but it is less specific and could refer to a wide range of actions (e.g., picking up an object from the floor). While there is semantic overlap in the lifting motion, 'pick up' does not clearly convey the controlled, repetitive elbow flexion characteristic of a bicep curl. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to being a plausible but imprecise match."
videos/session_0723_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."

The prediction 'dancing' is a broad, dynamic activity that does not specifically align with this precise motion. While dancing may involve circular arm movements, it is too generic and semantically distant from the exact task described by the ground truth, especially given that 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a deliberate, isolated gesture rather than a freeform activity like dancing."
videos/session_0731_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction.

The predicted action 'drinking' involves bringing a container to the mouth and consuming liquid—these actions differ significantly in intent, motion, and body part usage. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between blowing one's nose and drinking, especially in a thermal video where such fine-grained but distinguishable heat patterns (e.g., hand near face vs. cup near mouth) would likely differentiate them. Thus, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0813_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: dancing,0.6,"The ground truth 'stretchoneself' refers to deliberate stretching movements, while the prediction 'dancing' implies rhythmic or expressive motion. Although both are dynamic and may involve similar body movements (e.g., arm or leg extension), dancing is not a specific form of stretching nor a typical temporal part of it. However, given the abstract nature of thermal videos and possible overlap in motion patterns, the actions are related but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."

The predicted action 'speaking' is a completely different activity that does not inherently involve touching the face. While speaking might occasionally coincide with incidental face touches, it is not a semantic equivalent, temporal part, or plausible interpretation of 'touchface'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0815_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handing over,0.6,"The predicted action 'handing over' is related to the ground truth 'handshake' as both involve a brief interpersonal hand interaction, but they are not semantically equivalent.

videos/session_0820_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies social interaction, typically involving people facing each other and possibly standing or sitting still while talking. 'Walking' is a locomotive activity that generally does not involve conversational engagement unless explicitly shown with interacting individuals. Given the lack of indication that walking occurs during a conversation (e.g., walking while talking), and considering the thermal, low-resolution nature of the input which likely emphasizes motion over fine interaction cues, the prediction represents a fundamentally different activity category and thus earns a low score."

While a person doing pushups may briefly be in a prone position, 'lying down' implies rest rather than active motion, making this a largely incorrect and overly generic interpretation for a clearly dynamic action."
videos/session_0955_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: dance,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'dance' describes a completely different category of activity that does not encompass or closely relate to the targeted, isolated movement of a leg raise. While both are dynamic actions, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in motion pattern or intent."
videos/session_0956_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm movements. 'Clapping' is a different hand/arm action with distinct motion patterns and intent. While both involve upper body movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0957_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Clapping,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, aggressive arm movements such as punching, while the predicted action 'clapping' is a distinct, rhythmic hand motion typically associated with applause. These actions are visually and semantically dissimilar, especially in the context of thermal video where motion patterns are key. Clapping does not represent a temporal phase, component, or plausible interpretation of boxing."
videos/session_0958_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: looking around,0.3,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers to a specific, deliberate lateral or vertical movement of the head to indicate 'no' or 'yes'. The prediction 'looking around' implies eye or head movement to observe surroundings, which is a different intent and motion pattern. While both involve head movement, they are not semantically equivalent nor temporal parts of each other, and 'looking around' is not a valid interpretation of 'shakehead'."
videos/session_0959_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0960_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drinking,0.6,"Drinking is a related activity to eating, as both involve consuming substances and often occur in similar contexts (e.g., at a table). However, they are distinct actions with different hand-to-mouth motions and object interactions. While not completely unrelated, the prediction is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'eat', placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0961_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0962_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a completely different activity with different motion patterns and intent. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0963_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking up an object typically involves bending down. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action sequence."
videos/session_0964_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' refers to a specific, rhythmic, dynamic activity involving jumping over a rope. The prediction 'dancing' is a different category of movement that, while also dynamic, does not align with the specific motion pattern of jump roping. Although both are active, they are semantically distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent, and 'dancing' is not a temporal part or valid instantiation of 'jumprope'."
videos/session_0965_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'handshake' exactly matches the ground truth action 'handshake', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0966_hug.mp4,hug,Action: kissing,0.3,"While both 'hug' and 'kissing' involve close interpersonal contact, they are distinct actions with different physical characteristics. A hug typically involves embracing with arms, whereas kissing involves facial contact. The actions are related socially but not semantically equivalent or temporal parts of each other, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0967_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a dynamic, interactive physical act involving force or contact with another person. The prediction 'standing' describes a static, non-interactive posture that does not capture any part of the pushing action—neither as a temporal phase nor as a semantically related behavior. This is a clear mismatch, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'Kicking' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it captures the core physical action involved, even if the target ('someone') is not explicitly mentioned."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: taking body temperature,0.0,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies a dynamic, aggressive motion involving striking another person. The predicted action 'taking body temperature' is a completely unrelated, static, and non-interactive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0970_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: handshake,0.8,"A handshake is a specific form of social interaction that commonly occurs during a conversation. While not identical, it is a semantically related and plausible component of the broader 'conversation' context, especially in thermal video where fine details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, active movement that falls within the reasonable scope of actions one might perform in a gym or during a freestyle exercise session, especially given the instruction for 'freestyle' to mean any self-chosen action. Therefore, it is a semantically valid and specific instance of the abstract 'gym' category."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, physically active movement that falls within the plausible range of actions someone might perform in a gym or during a freestyle exercise session, especially given the context that 'freestyle' means the person can do any action they choose. Thus, it is a semantically valid and specific instance of the abstract 'gym' category."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: reaching,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Reaching' is a specific, plausible voluntary action consistent with the freestyle label, and thus constitutes a correct and reasonable prediction."
videos/session_0974_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, physically active movement that reasonably falls under the broad interpretation of 'gym' in this context, especially since 'freestyle' (as defined) allows any self-chosen action. Thus, the prediction is semantically appropriate."
videos/session_0975_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: walk,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walk' is a valid, specific action that falls under this open-ended category, making it a correct and reasonable prediction."
