videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sitting down,1.0,"The prediction 'Sitting down' is a direct temporal part of the ground truth action 'sit', which explicitly includes transitions into or out of the seated posture as correct."
videos/session_0002_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'Bending' accurately captures the core physical motion involved in bowing, even if it lacks the specific contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid interpretation."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Fall,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sleep' implies a state of rest or inactivity, typically lying down with eyes closed. The predicted action 'Fall' describes a sudden, dynamic event that is not a temporal part of sleeping nor semantically related. Falling might precede or interrupt sleep in rare cases, but it is not a logical or typical component of the 'sleep' activity, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Throw,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement, while the predicted action 'Throw' describes a completely different and unrelated physical activity. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between throwing and dancing, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: jogging,1.0,The prediction 'jogging' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'jog'.
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling,1.0,"The prediction 'Falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same physical event with only minor phrasing differences."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Squatting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both legs leaving the ground, while 'squatting' is a static or downward bending motion typically performed without leaving the ground. These actions are biomechanically and semantically distinct, with no significant temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jumping jacks,1.0,"The prediction 'Jumping jacks' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'jumpingjack', differing only in formatting and capitalization."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squatting,1.0,"The prediction 'Squatting' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'squat', representing the same physical activity."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Lunging,1.0,"The prediction 'Lunging' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'lunge', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund). This constitutes a correct identification of the activity."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turn,1.0,"The predicted action 'Turn' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'turn', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Bend,0.6,"The predicted action 'Bend' is related to 'pushup' as bending the elbows and lowering the body is a key component of performing a pushup. However, 'Bend' is overly generic and could refer to many other actions (e.g., bending at the waist), making it less specific than the ground truth. This falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap without clear identification of the full action."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Squatting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise where a person raises their legs while lying down or seated, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'squatting' involves bending the knees and hips to lower the body, which is a distinctly different movement pattern and muscle engagement. While both are exercises, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or interchangeable under abstract labels. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Juggling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The prediction 'juggling' involves a distinctly different set of coordinated hand and arm motions with no semantic or kinematic overlap. Both are dynamic actions, but they are unrelated in intent, motion pattern, and context, constituting a completely different activity."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Aiming with a rifle,0.0,"The predicted action 'Aiming with a rifle' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'boxing'. The two actions involve different body movements, contexts, and intents, with no semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Looking around,0.3,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers to a specific, deliberate lateral or vertical movement of the head, typically indicating 'no' or 'yes'. The prediction 'Looking around' implies eye or head movement to observe surroundings, which may involve some head motion but is semantically distinct and not a temporal part or equivalent of 'shakehead'. While both involve head movement, the intent and pattern differ significantly, making this a partial but insufficient match."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Phone Call,1.0,"The prediction 'Phone Call' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of engaging in a phone conversation."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal part or semantic equivalent, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is distinctly different from 'drinking', an action typically involving holding a container and consuming liquid. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between these two actions, and 'drinking' does not represent a plausible part or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Bend,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pickup' typically involves bending down to retrieve an object. The predicted action 'Bend' accurately captures the core physical motion required for 'pickup', even if it doesn't specify the full intent. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on observable motion, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid representation of the action."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping Jacks,0.3,"While both 'jumprope' and 'jumping jacks' are dynamic, rhythmic exercises involving jumping, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping rope specifically involves rotating a rope and timing jumps with its motion, whereas jumping jacks involve simultaneous arm and leg abduction/adduction without equipment. The prediction is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of jumprope, nor is it a valid instance under an abstract label—'jumprope' is a specific activity. Thus, the match is incorrect but related, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Putting down object,0.2,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a dynamic, repetitive cleaning motion with a mop, typically requiring arm and body movement. The prediction 'Putting down object' describes a brief, static interaction that does not capture the essence or typical motion of mopping. While placing an object could occur before or after mopping, it is not a logical temporal part of the mopping action itself and lacks the specificity or semantic alignment required for a higher score."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Phone call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person grooming their hair, typically with hand movements near the head. The predicted action 'Phone call' implies holding a phone to the ear, which is a completely different activity with distinct hand and head positioning. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Handshake,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Handshake' is a social gesture involving two people grasping hands, which is anatomically, functionally, and contextually unrelated to a bicep curl. There is no temporal, semantic, or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same core activity of interacting with a mobile phone."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a distinctly different activity involving holding a cup or bottle and consuming liquid. While both may involve hand-to-mouth motion, the context, object usage, and intent differ significantly. Given the constraints of thermal video (which lacks fine detail), some ambiguity is expected, but 'drinking' is not a plausible temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'brushteeth', warranting a low score."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: typing,1.0,"The prediction 'typing' is a direct and exact match for the ground truth action 'type', as both refer to the same activity of inputting text on a keyboard."

videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Punching,0.0,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture, while the predicted action 'Punching' is a completely different and unrelated movement involving forceful arm motion. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Hand Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb and index finger form a circle (the 'OK' sign). The predicted action 'Hand Waving' describes a different, unrelated hand movement involving waving, which does not correspond to forming the OK sign. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intent and form, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' specifically refers to forming a 'V' shape with the fingers, typically as a gesture. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture involving an extended index finger, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of making a victory sign. While both involve hand movements, they represent distinct gestures with different meanings and configurations."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'Hand waving' describes a general, often back-and-forth or random hand movement, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of drawing a circle. The actions are fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: One hand wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'One hand wave' describes a generic waving motion, which is typically linear or arc-like and lacks the precise circular trajectory and directional specificity required by the ground truth. The actions are fundamentally different in form and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or presenting a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. 'Hand waving' is a different communicative gesture with distinct motion and intent, not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of displaying a stop sign. The actions are unrelated in purpose and form."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'Waving' describes a distinctly different outward, repetitive hand motion typically used for greeting. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Arm wave,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a directed, forceful motion of pushing someone's hand away, likely involving resistance or interaction. The prediction 'Arm wave' describes a loose, rhythmic waving motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both involve arm movement, the intent, dynamics, and context differ significantly, making this a low-match case."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand to signal or greet."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Handshake,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a person using a broom or similar tool to clean a surface, typically with repetitive arm and body motion. The predicted action 'Handshake' is a completely different social interaction involving two people briefly grasping hands. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between sweeping and shaking hands, even considering partial or abstract interpretations."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Checking time,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, full-body movement involving gliding or moving along a surface, while the predicted action 'Checking time' describes a static, fine-motor gesture unrelated to sliding. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Waving Hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity, likely involving hand or arm movements tracing a zigzag pattern. While 'waving hand' involves hand motion, it is a broad, rhythmic gesture that does not specifically correspond to the controlled, directional movement required for drawing a zigzag. The actions are superficially related (both involve hands) but semantically distinct in intent and form, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Turn,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position or direction. The prediction 'Turn' describes a change in orientation, which can be a component of dodging but is less specific and lacks the evasive intent. While not an exact match, it is a related motion that could occur during a dodge, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding and swinging a ball toward pins. 'Pick up' could be a minor preparatory step (e.g., picking up a bowling ball), but it is too generic and does not capture the core or characteristic motion of bowling. Without evidence that the clip clearly shows only the pickup phase, this prediction is considered only weakly related."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Raise hand,1.0,"The predicted action 'Raise hand' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'liftupahand', differing only in phrasing but describing the same physical movement."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Thumbs Up,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light touch or brief contact, typically with a finger or hand. The prediction 'Thumbs Up' is a distinct gesture involving a sustained hand pose, not a tapping motion. While both involve hand actions, they are semantically and kinematically different, with no temporal or categorical overlap under the given constraints."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: handwaving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'handwaving' describes a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. While both involve hand motion, they serve different purposes and exhibit different kinematics, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, pointing lacks the specific trajectory and intent of drawing a triangle, making it only loosely related at best."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Sneezing,1.0,"The prediction 'Sneezing' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sneeze', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0050_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between coughing and drinking, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical nuance of instability inherent to 'stagger'. Given the distinct movement patterns and the absence of qualifiers like 'unsteady' or 'wobbling' in the prediction, this is a related but significantly different action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding and consuming a liquid, which is a completely different and unrelated activity. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between yawning and drinking."
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video due to head/upper body motion, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and mechanics. Blowing one's nose typically involves holding a tissue and deliberate nasal clearing, whereas coughing is a reflexive throat/chest action. The VLM's prediction is related but not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or valid instance of 'blownose', warranting a low score."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Take off jacket,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' refers to a dynamic movement involving extending or flexing the body, while the predicted action 'Take off jacket' is a completely different activity involving clothing manipulation. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Phoning,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'Phoning' implies holding a phone to the ear or face. Although phoning may sometimes involve touching the face, it is a distinct activity with a different intent and typical hand positioning. The actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is phoning a temporal phase of touching one's face. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0056_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0057_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Handshake,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful, directional physical interaction, while the predicted action 'Handshake' describes a consensual, friendly gesture. These actions are semantically and physically distinct in intent, motion, and social context. There is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kick,1.0,"The prediction 'Kick' is a direct and semantically equivalent match to the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it accurately captures the core action being performed."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: side-box,0.9,"The predicted action 'side-box' is a specific type of punching motion commonly associated with boxing or striking, which aligns closely with the ground truth 'punchsomeone'. While not an exact lexical match, it represents a semantically equivalent and contextually appropriate instance of the intended aggressive striking action."
videos/session_0061_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: talking,1.0,"The prediction 'talking' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'conversation', as conversation inherently involves talking between individuals."

videos/session_0064_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bowing,1.0,"The prediction 'Bowing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'bow', representing the same human activity."
videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and 'lying down' is a core and necessary component of sleeping. While not all instances of lying down result in sleep, in the context of HAR and given the constraints of thermal video (which may not capture subtle cues like eye closure), predicting 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned interpretation of the 'sleep' label."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jumping jacks,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of rhythmic or expressive movements. 'Jumping jacks' is a specific, active movement that could reasonably occur within a freestyle dance context, especially given the instruction for 'freestyle' to mean any self-chosen action. Therefore, the prediction is a valid instance of the broader 'dance' category."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jogging,1.0,"The prediction 'Jogging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'jog', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."

videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Bending,0.6,"The predicted action 'Bending' is related to 'pushup' as pushups involve bending at the elbows and lowering the body, but it is less specific and could describe many other actions (e.g., bending forward, picking something up). While not an exact match or a clear temporal phase of a pushup, it captures a plausible component of the motion, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0075_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Take a step,0.1,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Take a step' describes ambulation or walking, which is a fundamentally different movement pattern and not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or plausible variant of a legraise. The two actions involve distinct body mechanics and intent, resulting in a very low similarity score."
videos/session_0076_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Hand clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm and hand movements. 'Hand clapping' is a different rhythmic hand action but does not resemble drumming gestures. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically distinct activities with different movement patterns, making this a largely incorrect prediction."

videos/session_0078_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Turning head,0.9,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' involves lateral or rotational movement of the head, and the predicted action 'Turning head' describes a closely related motion. While not an exact lexical match, it captures the essential dynamic head movement implied by 'shakehead', making it a semantically equivalent and valid interpretation in the context of thermal video with limited resolution."
videos/session_0079_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking constitutes answering a phone, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0080_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'eat' and the predicted action 'Drinking' are related in that both involve consuming something, but they are distinct activities with different physical motions (e.g., using utensils vs. holding a cup). While they may co-occur, one is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of the other. Therefore, the prediction is considered largely incorrect."
videos/session_0081_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0082_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is distinctly different from 'drinking', an action typically involving holding a container and consuming liquid. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between these two actions, and 'drinking' does not represent a plausible part or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0083_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Picking up,1.0,"The prediction 'Picking up' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'pickup', differing only in grammatical form."
videos/session_0084_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Shrug,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a dynamic, full-body activity involving rhythmic jumping. The predicted action 'Shrug' refers to a small, static shoulder movement that is neither a temporal part of jumprope nor semantically related. The two actions are fundamentally different in motion, intent, and body involvement."
videos/session_0085_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Put down rifle,0.0,"The predicted action 'Put down rifle' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. There is no semantic, contextual, or temporal overlap between handling a rifle and mopping a floor, especially in a thermal video context where object details are limited but gross motor actions should align. This constitutes a clear hallucination or misinterpretation."
videos/session_0086_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Head scratch,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'head scratch' involve hand-to-head contact, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with an implement (like a brush), whereas head scratching is a brief, localized motion often involving fingers. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing hair, nor is it a plausible abstraction under the given label."
videos/session_0087_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving lifting a weight toward the shoulder. The predicted action 'Drinking' describes a completely different activity involving holding a container and consuming liquid.

videos/session_0089_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing teeth. While both involve the mouth area, they are distinct activities with different motion patterns and intents, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0090_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially since 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."

These are distinct gestures with different meanings and motion patterns, making them semantically unrelated in this context."
videos/session_0093_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Hand Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb and index finger form a circle (the 'OK' sign). The predicted action 'Hand Waving' describes a different, unrelated hand movement involving waving, which does not correspond to forming the OK sign. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and visually distinct actions with different intent and form, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0094_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Hand waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the index and middle finger in a V-shape), while the prediction 'Hand waving' describes a different, broader hand motion. Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and form. The prediction is not a temporal part nor a valid variant of making a victory sign, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0095_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down hand motion, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of drawing a circle. The actions are visually and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0096_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Touch shoulder,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The predicted action 'Touch shoulder' describes a completely different, non-circular, and localized movement that does not align temporally, semantically, or kinematically with the intended action. There is no plausible overlap or partial match between the two."
videos/session_0097_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving Hand,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'Waving Hand' describes a distinctly different gesture that does not correspond to displaying or holding a stop sign. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0098_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Draw Cross,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The prediction 'Draw Cross' implies a completely different activity involving drawing or marking a cross shape, which does not align semantically or kinematically with pulling a hand in. There is no evident temporal or categorical relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0099_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Gunshot,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a physical gesture involving repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely in a defensive or interactive context. The predicted action 'Gunshot' is entirely unrelated, representing a sudden auditory event or violent act with no semantic or temporal overlap with the actual motion depicted. This constitutes a complete mismatch and likely a hallucination."
videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Throw,0.1,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a person moving their hand in a waving motion, typically as a greeting or signal. The predicted action 'Throw' implies a forceful propulsion of an object or limb, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from waving. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or temporal phase between the two actions."
videos/session_0101_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving hand,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving hand' is a distinct gesture usually involving a single arm moving up and down or side to side in a social context. The motions are visually and semantically dissimilar, and 'waving' is not a plausible temporal part or variant of 'sweeping'."
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Right Hand Wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, full-body movement involving gliding or moving along a surface, whereas the predicted action 'Right Hand Wave' is a localized upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding. The two actions are fundamentally different in nature and intent."
videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific fine-motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with a hand or tool. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different hand gesture that does not involve the repetitive, directional motion characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no clear temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Head Roll,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a rapid, evasive body movement, typically involving the whole body shifting direction or posture to avoid something. 'Head Roll' is a slow, isolated head movement that does not align with the dynamic, full-body nature of dodging. The actions are semantically and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0106_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding a ball, swinging the arm, and releasing toward pins. 'Picking up' could be a minor preparatory step (e.g., picking up a bowling ball), but it is not a core or defining part of the bowling action itself. Without clear evidence that the clip shows this preparatory phase in the context of bowling, the prediction is too generic and only weakly related, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0107_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Hand Wave,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' refers to raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'Hand Wave'. While waving typically involves movement back and forth, the core action of lifting a hand is present, and in low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing between a static lift and a wave may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is a reasonable interpretation of the intended action."
videos/session_0108_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Waving hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the prediction 'waving hand' describes a broader, sweeping motion typically used for greeting or signaling. Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Therefore, the prediction does not match the ground truth closely enough to warrant a higher score."
videos/session_0109_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, likely in a controlled or repetitive manner. The prediction 'Waving hand' describes a different hand motion—typically a side-to-side or up-and-down movement used for greeting or signaling—which does not align with the mechanics or intent of 'spreadandpinch'. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0110_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Waving left arm,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape. The prediction 'Waving left arm' describes a different, rhythmic motion that does not align with the geometric precision implied by 'drawtriangle'. While both involve arm movement, the intent and pattern are fundamentally different, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Sneezing / Coughing,0.9,"The ground truth action is 'sneeze', and the prediction 'Sneezing / Coughing' includes sneezing as a primary option. Although coughing is an additional possibility, sneezing is explicitly mentioned, making it a strong semantic match. The slight ambiguity from including coughing justifies a minor deduction from a perfect score."
videos/session_0112_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory reflex, while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic overlap, temporal relationship, or contextual similarity between coughing and drinking in this scenario."
videos/session_0113_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Bending,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty. 'Bending' is a distinct, controlled motion that does not capture the essence of staggering, nor is it a typical temporal component of it. The two actions are semantically dissimilar and belong to different movement categories."
videos/session_0114_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouth inhalation typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different behavior involving consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them related."
videos/session_0115_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is visually and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0116_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Side Bend,0.9,"The predicted action 'Side Bend' is a specific type of stretching movement, which falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself'. This is a semantically valid and precise instance of the ground truth label."
videos/session_0117_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'Drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth. Although both may involve hand-to-head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and visual patterns in thermal video. Drinking is not a temporal phase or valid variant of touching one's face, nor are they interchangeable under abstract labeling. Thus, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0118_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0119_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Pushing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'hug' involves close, affectionate physical contact between individuals, typically with arms around each other. The predicted action 'Pushing' implies forceful physical contact in the opposite direction, which is semantically and physically distinct from hugging. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would make pushing a valid part of hugging, nor are they related actions under abstract categories. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0120_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Pushing,1.0,"The prediction 'Pushing' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'pushsomeone', accurately capturing the core interaction depicted in the thermal video clip."
videos/session_0121_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'Kicking' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as kicking inherently implies the act of kicking someone in this context."
videos/session_0122_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Shaking Hands,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion directed at another person, while the predicted action 'Shaking Hands' describes a friendly, cooperative social gesture. These actions are semantically and physically opposite in intent and execution, with no temporal or contextual overlap. Therefore, the prediction is almost entirely incorrect."
videos/session_0123_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Handshake,0.8,"A handshake is a specific form of social interaction that commonly occurs during a conversation. While not all conversations involve handshakes, a handshake strongly implies verbal or non-verbal communication between people, making it a semantically related and plausible instance of the broader 'conversation' label."
videos/session_0124_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sitting down,1.0,"The prediction 'Sitting down' is a direct and valid temporal part of the ground truth action 'sit', fully aligning with the expected behavior for this label."

videos/session_0126_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bowing,1.0,"The prediction 'Bowing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'bow', representing the same human activity."
videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying Down,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying Down' is a core component of the ground truth action 'sleep', as sleeping typically involves lying down. While not an exact synonym, it is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid posture for sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Hands Up,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of expressive movements. 'Hands Up' describes a specific, active gesture commonly associated with dancing, especially in contexts like freestyle or celebratory dance. Given the thermal, low-resolution nature of the video and the allowance for partial/temporal actions, this prediction is a plausible and semantically relevant instance of dancing."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Turning,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jog' implies continuous, rhythmic forward motion involving running at a slow pace. The predicted action 'Turning' describes a change in direction or orientation, which is not a typical or necessary component of jogging. While turning might occasionally occur during jogging (e.g., around a corner), it is not semantically equivalent, a temporal phase, or a specific instance of jogging. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0130_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling,1.0,"The prediction 'Falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same event with slightly different phrasing."
videos/session_0131_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Squat,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both legs leaving the ground, while the predicted action 'squat' is a static or controlled lowering motion typically performed without leaving the ground. These are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent; squatting is not a temporal phase of jumping, nor are they semantically equivalent or closely related in this context."
videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a dynamic, full-body exercise involving repeated jumping and arm movements. The prediction 'standing' describes a static posture with no motion, which is inconsistent with the expected activity. According to the evaluation criteria, assigning a generic static label like 'standing' to a clearly dynamic action such as 'jumpingjack' warrants a low score."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a dynamic, lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically with movement downward and upward. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static, upright posture with no indication of the squatting motion or its temporal phases (e.g., lowering into a squat or rising from one). Since 'standing' is not a logical temporal part of 'squat' and fails to capture the essential movement, it is considered a completely different and incorrect action."
videos/session_0134_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Bending,0.6,"A lunge involves bending one knee while keeping the other foot forward, so 'bending' captures a key component of the movement. However, 'bending' is overly generic and could refer to many actions (e.g., bending at the waist), making it less specific than the ground truth 'lunge'. This qualifies as a related but less precise description, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0135_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turn,1.0,"The predicted action 'Turn' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'turn', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0136_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Burpee,0.8,"Both 'pushup' and 'burpee' are specific, dynamic calisthenic exercises commonly performed in gym or fitness contexts. While not identical, they share significant semantic and functional overlap as full-body strength movements involving similar postures (e.g., plank position). Given the abstract nature of exercise-related actions and the VLM's plausible interpretation of a complex thermal motion sequence, this constitutes a high-similarity prediction."
videos/session_0137_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching' describes an upright, rhythmic walking-like movement, which is biomechanically and contextually distinct from a leg raise. While both involve leg movement, they belong to different categories of activity (static/core-focused vs. dynamic/locomotive), and 'marching' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'legraise'."
videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Shrug shoulders,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, coordinated arm movements mimicking drumming, typically energetic and dynamic. The prediction 'shrug shoulders' describes a small, isolated upper-body motion that is neither a temporal phase nor a semantic equivalent of airdrumming. The actions are functionally and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0139_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The prediction 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'boxing', as punching or throwing punches is fundamental to boxing. While not an exact label match, it accurately captures a defining movement of the activity."
videos/session_0140_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Head turn,0.9,"The predicted action 'Head turn' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead'. Both involve deliberate lateral or rotational movement of the head, and in low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing between a full 'head shake' (typically side-to-side) and a 'head turn' may be ambiguous. Given the context and the instruction to consider action similarity over exact wording, this is a near-equivalent interpretation."
videos/session_0141_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0142_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Using binoculars,0.0,"The predicted action 'Using binoculars' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'eat'. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."

videos/session_0144_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Taking a picture,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'Taking a picture' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible interpretation under which taking a picture constitutes wiping one's face or a related phase of that action."
videos/session_0145_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Pick up,1.0,"The prediction 'Pick up' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'pickup', differing only in phrasing (verb form vs. noun form). This constitutes a correct identification of the action."
videos/session_0146_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping Jacks,0.3,"While both 'jumprope' and 'jumping jacks' are dynamic, rhythmic exercises involving jumping, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping rope specifically involves rotating a rope and timing jumps with its motion, whereas jumping jacks involve simultaneous arm and leg abduction/adduction without equipment. The VLM's prediction is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of jumprope, nor is it a valid instance under an abstract label—'jumprope' is a specific activity. Thus, the prediction is related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0147_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Golf Swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'Golf Swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive sweeping motions with a mop, typically close to the ground and using both hands, while a golf swing is a distinct, sport-specific motion involving a club and a very different posture and movement pattern. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0148_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (e.g., a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion usually in response to an itch. Given the specificity of the ground truth label and the lack of evidence that scratching is a temporal or semantic part of brushing hair, the prediction is considered a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0149_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving lifting a weight toward the shoulder. The predicted action 'Drinking' describes a completely unrelated activity involving holding and consuming a liquid. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0150_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same core activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0151_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0152_type.mp4,type,Action: Reading,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Reading' is a completely different activity that does not involve typing and is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or plausible component of typing. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect."

videos/session_0154_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Wave Left,0.0,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Wave Left' describes a different hand motion (waving). These are semantically and visually distinct gestures with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0155_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Hand wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb and index finger form a circle (the 'OK' sign). The predicted action 'Hand wave' describes a different hand movement involving waving, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of forming the OK sign. The two actions involve distinct hand configurations and intentions, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0156_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Two-Finger Pointing,0.9,"The predicted action 'Two-Finger Pointing' is a semantically equivalent description of 'makevictorysign', as the victory sign is commonly made using two fingers (index and middle finger) in a V-shape. The actions are visually and functionally aligned."
videos/session_0157_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Hand waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or random hand movement that lacks the precise circular trajectory and directional intent of drawing a circle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0158_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The prediction 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between pointing and drawing a counter-clockwise circle, making this a nearly complete mismatch."
videos/session_0159_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'Waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no plausible temporal or categorical relationship between waving and presenting or holding a stop sign."
videos/session_0160_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Draw cross,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The prediction 'Draw cross' describes an entirely different activity involving drawing or marking, which does not align semantically or kinematically with pulling a hand in. There is no clear temporal, functional, or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0161_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Throw,0.6,"The ground truth 'pushhandaway' implies a deliberate pushing motion directed away from the body, likely involving repelling or deflecting with the hand. The prediction 'Throw' shares some kinematic similarity—both involve outward arm motion—but 'throw' typically implies releasing an object, which may not be present or intended in 'pushhandaway'. While not an exact match, the actions are related in direction and intent, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0162_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: changing a lightbulb,0.0,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a person moving their hand in a waving motion, typically as a greeting or signal. The predicted action 'changing a lightbulb' is a completely different activity involving object manipulation and likely upper-body movement, but not the specific rhythmic or communicative hand motion implied by 'handwave'. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0163_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Handshake,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a person using a broom or similar tool to clean a surface, typically with repetitive arm and body motion. The predicted action 'Handshake' is a completely different social interaction involving two people briefly grasping hands. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between sweeping and shaking hands, making this a clear mismatch."

videos/session_0165_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Hand waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or prone position (e.g., on a slide, floor, or snow). 'Hand waving' is a completely different upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding. The actions are unrelated in motion type, body involvement, and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0166_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a dynamic, deliberate drawing motion (likely with hands or body tracing a zigzag pattern), which is fundamentally different from the predicted action 'Standing', a static posture with no indication of drawing or movement. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0167_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: throw,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick evasive movement, typically involving lateral or backward motion to avoid something. The predicted action 'throw' involves a forward-propelling motion of an object and is semantically distinct from dodging. There is no significant overlap in intent, motion pattern, or temporal relationship between the two actions, making this a largely incorrect prediction."

videos/session_0169_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Hand Waving,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' refers to raising a hand, which is semantically very close to 'Hand Waving'. While waving typically involves repeated motion and lifting is more static, both involve deliberate upward movement of the hand and occur in similar contexts (e.g., signaling). Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this is a reasonable and largely equivalent interpretation."
videos/session_0170_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Throwing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'Throwing' involves a forceful, dynamic motion of propelling an object. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion, and physical execution, with no temporal or semantic overlap."

The prediction 'Left hand waving' describes a completely different motion—waving involves oscillatory movement of the hand, not the precise spreading and pinching motion. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or functional overlap."
videos/session_0172_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Handwaving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, controlled hand movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. 'Handwaving' is a generic, rhythmic waving motion that does not correspond to the precise, geometric nature of drawing a triangle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with different intent and form."
videos/session_0173_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.7,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, reflexive respiratory actions that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of upper body motion and head movement. While not identical, they are closely related and plausible confusions given the input constraints."
videos/session_0174_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Head Nod,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' involves a sudden, forceful expulsion of air from the lungs, often accompanied by characteristic torso and head movements. 'Head nod' describes a vertical head movement typically associated with agreement or drowsiness, which is not a typical component or temporal phase of coughing. The two actions are semantically and physically distinct, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0179_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'Drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth. Although both may involve hand-to-head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution. Drinking is not a temporal phase or reasonable interpretation of touching one's face, leading to a low score."

videos/session_0189_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and 'lying down' is a core, necessary posture for sleeping. While not all lying down implies sleeping, in the context of thermal video clips labeled as 'sleep', the model's prediction captures the essential physical state associated with the activity. Thus, it is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid interpretation."
videos/session_0190_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Shoulder Press,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic whole-body movement typically associated with expressive or coordinated motion. The predicted action 'Shoulder Press' is a specific strength-training exercise focused on the upper body and is not semantically related to dancing. While both are physical activities, they belong to different activity domains (exercise vs. expressive movement), and a shoulder press is not a plausible temporal part or subtype of dancing. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Turning,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jog' implies continuous, rhythmic forward motion involving running or fast walking. The predicted action 'Turning' describes a change in direction, which is not a core component or temporal phase of jogging.

videos/session_0198_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Mountain Climbers,0.9,"Both 'pushup' and 'Mountain Climbers' are specific, dynamic calisthenic exercises commonly performed in similar contexts (e.g., gym, home workout). While not identical, they are semantically close as core bodyweight strength-training movements involving similar postures and effort levels. Given the abstract nature of exercise labels and the VLM's plausible interpretation of a physically active pose in a low-resolution thermal clip, this constitutes a high-similarity match."
videos/session_0199_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching' describes an upright, alternating leg-lifting motion usually performed while standing or walking in place. While both involve leg movement, they are biomechanically and contextually distinct: legraise is static and supine/prone-focused, whereas marching is dynamic and upright. Given the specificity of 'legraise' and the mismatch in posture and motion pattern, this is considered a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0200_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements.

The predicted action 'Shrug' refers to a small, static shoulder movement that is neither a temporal part of jump roping nor semantically related. The two actions are fundamentally different in motion, intensity, and body involvement."
videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Golf swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'Golf swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive, sweeping motions close to the ground, typically with a mop, while a golf swing is an overhead or lateral striking motion with a club. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Putting on a hat,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming the hair with a brush or similar tool, while the predicted action 'Putting on a hat' is a distinctly different activity involving headwear. Although both actions involve the head region, they are semantically unrelated and do not represent temporal phases or variants of each other. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0211_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Point with one arm,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow to lift a weight. The predicted action 'Point with one arm' describes a completely different gesture that does not involve the repetitive, resistance-based motion characteristic of a bicep curl. There is no meaningful semantic or temporal overlap between pointing and performing a bicep curl, making this a clear mismatch."

videos/session_0213_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a different activity with distinct motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with minimal overlap in context or motion, especially in thermal video where fine details are limited but gross motion differs."
videos/session_0214_type.mp4,type,Action: playing video game,0.2,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which typically involves fine hand movements while seated. The prediction 'playing video game' is a different activity that may involve typing but is semantically distinct and broader in scope.

videos/session_0219_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Right hand wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular motion of the hand (likely tracing a clockwise circle), while the prediction 'Right hand wave' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down motion. Although both involve hand movement, the motion patterns are fundamentally distinct, and waving is not a plausible temporal segment or semantic equivalent of drawing a clockwise circle."
videos/session_0220_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Hand Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Hand Waving' describes a generic, often back-and-forth or random hand movement that lacks the precision and directional intent of drawing a circle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0221_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or presenting a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. 'Hand waving' is a different communicative gesture with distinct motion and intent, not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of displaying a stop sign. The actions are unrelated in purpose and form."
videos/session_0222_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: check time,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific movement involving pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body.

'Hand waving' is a different type of arm/hand motion that lacks the controlled, directional nature of drawing. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and trajectory, making this a partial but insufficient match."
videos/session_0229_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Turn,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in direction or body position. The prediction 'Turn' is related, as turning can be part of dodging, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the evasive or reactive nature of dodging. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap."
videos/session_0230_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Pick Up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding a ball, swinging the arm, and releasing toward pins. 'Pick Up' may refer to an initial phase (e.g., picking up a bowling ball), but it is too generic and does not clearly capture the core or characteristic motion of bowling.

videos/session_0271_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements and intent, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained tool differentiation (mop vs. broom) may not be visible. Given the context and constraints, this is a highly plausible and closely related prediction."
videos/session_0272_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming behavior near the head, while the predicted action 'Drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth. These actions are anatomically and semantically distinct with no temporal or contextual overlap in this context."
videos/session_0273_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repetitive arm flexion, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Drinking' involves bringing a container to the mouth and is functionally and kinematically unrelated to a bicep curl. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0274_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0275_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch."
videos/session_0276_type.mp4,type,Action: Turning head,0.1,"The ground truth action 'type' implies keyboard typing or similar fine motor activity involving hands and fingers, while the predicted action 'Turning head' is a completely different and unrelated movement. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."

videos/session_0278_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct meaning and configuration. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally unrelated, constituting a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0279_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Hand Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb and index finger form a circle (the 'OK' sign). The prediction 'Hand Waving' describes a different, unrelated hand movement involving waving, which does not match or closely resemble forming the OK sign. While both involve hands, the actions are semantically distinct with no temporal or functional overlap."
videos/session_0280_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Two-finger wave,0.9,"The predicted action 'Two-finger wave' closely resembles the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both involve raising two fingers in a gesture. The victory sign is commonly executed with the index and middle finger, which can appear similar to a two-finger wave in low-resolution thermal video. Given the semantic and visual similarity, this is considered a near-equivalent match."
videos/session_0281_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Point,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Point' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. While both may involve arm movement, 'pointing' is not a temporal phase or equivalent of drawing a circle, nor is it a plausible abstraction of the intended action."
videos/session_0282_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: check time,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The predicted action 'check time' suggests a brief glance at a watch or clock, which is a completely different and unrelated behavior. There is no semantic overlap, temporal relationship, or contextual plausibility linking the two actions."
videos/session_0283_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand push,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or presenting a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The prediction 'Hand push' suggests an active pushing motion, which is semantically unrelated to displaying a stop sign. There is no clear temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0284_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Blow kiss,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific movement involving pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The predicted action 'Blow kiss' is a completely different gesture involving hand and facial motion unrelated to pulling the hand in. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0285_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Push,0.9,"The predicted action 'Push' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'pushhandaway', as it captures the core physical interaction implied by the label. While slightly less specific, it correctly identifies the pushing motion directed at a hand, which aligns with the intended action."
videos/session_0286_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving hand,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving hand' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', describing the same specific gesture with only minor phrasing differences."
videos/session_0287_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'hand waving' describes a different, often social or signaling gesture with distinct motion patterns. Although both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with little overlap in intent or execution. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0288_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Juggling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves rhythmic hand movements typically near the chest, while 'juggling' requires continuous tossing and catching of objects with distinct arm motions. These actions are visually and semantically dissimilar in thermal video context, with no temporal or categorical overlap. The prediction appears to be a hallucination or misinterpretation."

These actions are semantically and physically unrelated, with no temporal or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0290_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movements in a controlled, repetitive angular motion. The prediction 'Waving' describes a broad, rhythmic arm motion typically used for greeting, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, the intent, trajectory, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0291_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Turn,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position or direction. The prediction 'Turn' is related, as turning can be part of a dodging motion, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the evasive or reactive nature of 'dodge'. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap."
videos/session_0292_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding and swinging a ball toward pins. 'Pick up' could be a minor preparatory step (e.g., picking up a bowling ball), but it is too generic and does not capture the core or characteristic motion of bowling. Without clear evidence that the clip shows the distinctive bowling motion, this prediction is only weakly related and overly vague."
videos/session_0293_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'pointing', as pointing typically requires lifting a hand and extending a finger. Given the low-resolution thermal video context and the high-level nature of labels, this prediction captures the essential motion and intent of the action."
videos/session_0294_tap.mp4,tap,Action: throw,0.1,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'throw' involves a forceful, dynamic motion of propelling an object through the air. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion, and physical execution, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0295_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Gunshot,0.0,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine motor hand gesture involving spreading and pinching fingers, likely in a controlled or deliberate manner. The predicted action 'Gunshot' is entirely unrelated, representing a sudden, violent event with no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap with the actual hand movement. This is a clear hallucination or misinterpretation."
videos/session_0296_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Point,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'Point' describes a different gesture—extending a finger toward a location—which does not constitute drawing a triangle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and trajectory. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated (e.g., both are upper-body gestures), warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0297_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.6,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, forceful respiratory actions that may appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of upper body motion and head movement. While not the same action, they are closely related and could be confused under limited visual information. However, they are distinct physiological events, so the match is partial but not exact."
videos/session_0298_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Coughing,1.0,"The prediction 'Coughing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'cough', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0299_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Turn,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty. The predicted action 'Turn' describes a controlled rotational movement, which is semantically distinct and does not capture the essence of staggering. There is no significant overlap in motion characteristics or intent between the two actions."

videos/session_0305_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug'.
videos/session_0306_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Punching,0.6,"While 'punching' and 'pushsomeone' are both aggressive or forceful interpersonal actions, they are distinct in intent and motion: punching involves a striking motion with a closed fist, whereas pushing typically uses open hands to exert force. However, in low-resolution thermal video, these actions may appear visually similar, and both involve direct physical contact. Thus, the prediction is related but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0307_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Torso Twisting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a dynamic, aggressive lower-body movement directed at another person. The prediction 'Torso Twisting' describes an upper-body rotational motion that does not involve kicking or interpersonal interaction. While both are active movements, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."

videos/session_0309_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Talking,1.0,"The prediction 'Talking' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'conversation', as conversation inherently involves talking between individuals."
videos/session_0310_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Squatting,0.6,"Squatting is a distinct action from sitting, but both involve lowering the body and can appear similar in low-resolution thermal video. While not a direct temporal phase of sitting (like 'sitting down'), squatting shares postural similarities and could be confused in ambiguous visual conditions. Thus, it is related but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0311_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Turn,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' implies forward locomotion, while the predicted action 'Turn' describes a change in orientation without necessarily involving walking. Although turning can occur during walking, it is not a sufficient or representative part of the 'walk' action on its own, especially in a thermal video context where motion dynamics are key. Thus, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0312_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bow,1.0,"The predicted action 'Bow' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'bow', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0313_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Fall,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sleep' implies a state of rest or inactivity, typically lying down with eyes closed. The predicted action 'Fall' describes a sudden, dynamic movement that is semantically and physically distinct from sleeping. While a person might fall before sleeping (e.g., collapsing), this is not a typical or logical temporal part of the act of sleeping itself. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0314_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Marching,0.6,"Marching is a rhythmic, coordinated movement that shares some characteristics with dance, such as intentional body motion and rhythm. However, 'marching' is typically more structured and militaristic, whereas 'dance' implies expressive or artistic movement. While not an exact match or a direct temporal phase of dancing, it is a related dynamic activity, warranting a medium score."

videos/session_0322_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Burpee,0.8,"Both 'pushup' and 'burpee' are specific, dynamic calisthenic exercises commonly performed in gym or fitness contexts. While not identical, they share significant semantic and physical overlap (e.g., both involve ground contact, upper body exertion, and are part of high-intensity workouts). Given the abstract nature of exercise-related actions and the VLM's plausible interpretation of a similar high-effort movement, this constitutes a strong but not exact match."
videos/session_0323_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise where a person lifts one or both legs while lying down or seated, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching' involves alternating leg lifts while standing or moving, which is a different movement pattern and muscle engagement. Although both involve leg motion, they are distinct exercises with different forms and contexts, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0324_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Juggling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'juggling' involves a distinctly different motion pattern—tossing and catching objects—and is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of airdrumming. The two actions are unrelated in form and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0325_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punching,1.0,"The prediction 'Punching' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'. It is not only semantically aligned but also a specific, accurate depiction of the activity."
videos/session_0326_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: turn,0.6,"The ground truth 'shakehead' refers to a specific head movement (side-to-side or up-and-down), while the prediction 'turn' is related but less precise—it could imply turning the head, body, or direction. Although 'turn' may partially overlap with head motion, it lacks the specificity of 'shakehead' and could describe a broader range of actions. This falls into the medium score range due to plausible but ambiguous similarity."
videos/session_0327_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0328_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drinking,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, making the prediction a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0329_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0330_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Taking a Picture,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'Taking a Picture' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible interpretation under which taking a picture constitutes wiping one's face, even considering partial or abstract interpretations."
videos/session_0331_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Pick up,1.0,"The prediction 'Pick up' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'pickup', differing only in phrasing (verb form vs. noun form). This constitutes a correct identification of the action."

There is no temporal or semantic relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0333_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). While not identical, they are closely related enough in context and intent to warrant a high score, especially given the low-resolution thermal video input which may obscure fine-grained distinctions."
videos/session_0334_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Salute,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to brush or comb their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'Salute' is a distinct gesture involving raising the hand to the forehead in a formal or military manner. While both actions involve hand movement near the head, they are semantically and functionally different with no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0335_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Putting on a backpack,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexing the elbow to lift a weight. The predicted action 'Putting on a backpack' involves a different motion (typically lifting and placing a bag over the shoulders) and does not correspond to any temporal or semantic part of a bicep curl. The actions are functionally and kinematically distinct, resulting in a complete mismatch."
videos/session_0336_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, while the predicted action 'Drinking' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap.

The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0338_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially given that 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0339_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Saluting,0.3,"While both 'thumbup' and 'saluting' involve raising a hand, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and hand configurations. A salute typically involves a flat hand near the forehead, whereas a thumbs-up is a closed fist with an extended thumb. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'thumbup', the prediction 'saluting' is not a valid temporal part nor a semantic equivalent, but it is loosely related due to the hand-raising motion, warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0340_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture, while the predicted action 'Drinking' describes an entirely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage.

The predicted action 'Hand Waving' describes a different, unrelated hand movement involving waving, which does not correspond to forming the OK sign. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and visually distinct actions with different intent and form, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0342_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Peace Sign,1.0,"The predicted action 'Peace Sign' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly known as the V-sign or victory/peace sign."
videos/session_0343_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Hand wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'Hand wave' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down gesture that does not match the circular motion required by the ground truth. While both involve hand movement, the motion patterns are fundamentally distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0344_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'hand waving' describes a generic, often rhythmic or non-circular hand movement that lacks the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a circle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."

The predicted action 'Hand wave' is a completely different gesture with distinct intent and motion, showing no semantic or temporal relationship to presenting a stop sign."
videos/session_0346_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Hand waving,0.3,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a specific action where a person pulls their hand inward, possibly toward the body or from an extended position. 'Hand waving' is a distinctly different motion involving repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down movement of the hand, typically for signaling. While both involve hand motion, the intent and trajectory differ significantly, making this a mismatch rather than a temporal or semantic variant."
videos/session_0347_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Right hand draw,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic motion of pushing one's hand away, likely involving forceful or deliberate movement. The prediction 'Right hand draw' suggests pulling or retracting the hand toward oneself, which is semantically opposite in direction and intent. This constitutes a fundamentally different action rather than a temporal phase or valid variant, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0348_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sit down,1.0,"The prediction 'Sit down' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'sit', representing a logical temporal part of the sitting action."
videos/session_0349_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Turning around,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' implies forward locomotion, while the predicted action 'Turning around' describes a rotational movement without clear indication of walking. Although both involve motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and movement patterns. Turning around is not a typical temporal part or variant of walking, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0350_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'Bending' accurately captures the core physical motion involved in bowing, even if it lacks the specific contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity rather than intent, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid match."
videos/session_0351_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and the predicted action 'Lying' accurately describes a key and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid component of the sleep action."
videos/session_0352_dance.mp4,dance,Action: High knees,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of rhythmic or expressive movements. 'High knees' is a specific, energetic movement commonly found in dance routines (e.g., in hip-hop, aerobic dance, or freestyle dancing). Given the context that 'freestyle' simply means performing any desired action, 'high knees' qualifies as a valid instance of dancing. Therefore, the prediction is semantically consistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Forward Kick,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jog' refers to a continuous, rhythmic running motion, while the predicted action 'Forward Kick' is a discrete, martial-arts-like movement that does not align with jogging either as a temporal part or a semantic equivalent. Although both involve leg movement, they are fundamentally different in intent, form, and dynamics."

videos/session_0359_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turning,1.0,The prediction 'Turning' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'turn'.
videos/session_0360_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Bending,0.6,"The predicted action 'Bending' is related to 'pushup' as pushups involve bending at the elbows and lowering the body, but it is less specific and could describe many other actions (e.g., bending forward, picking something up). While not an exact match or a clear temporal phase of a pushup, it captures a plausible component of the motion, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0361_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: High knees,0.3,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise where a person raises their legs while lying down or seated, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'High knees' involves standing and rapidly lifting knees toward the chest, which is a different dynamic movement with distinct biomechanics and posture. While both are leg-focused exercises, they are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal phase of the other. Therefore, the prediction is significantly mismatched."
videos/session_0362_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Rubbing hands,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, dynamic arm movements mimicking drumming in the air, typically with clear motion patterns. The prediction 'Rubbing hands' describes a different, more localized and repetitive hand motion that lacks the characteristic arm gestures and tempo of airdrumming. While both involve hand/arm activity, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0363_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punching,1.0,"The prediction 'Punching' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing', making it a semantically equivalent and correct interpretation."
videos/session_0364_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Turn Head,0.9,"The predicted action 'Turn Head' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead', as both involve deliberate lateral or rotational movement of the head. While not an exact lexical match, the actions are functionally equivalent in the context of human activity recognition from thermal video."
videos/session_0365_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Phone Call,1.0,"The prediction 'Phone Call' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of engaging in a phone conversation."

videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a dynamic, repetitive cleaning motion typically performed while standing and moving a mop across the floor. The prediction 'Pick up' suggests a brief, discrete action of lifting an object, which is not a typical or necessary part of mopping. While it's possible that someone might pick up a mop before mopping, the core activity described by the label is the act of mopping itself, not the preparatory step. Therefore, the prediction is only loosely related and does not capture the essence of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0372_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Putting on hat,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming one's hair, typically with a brush or hand. The predicted action 'Putting on hat' is a distinct activity that may involve touching the head but does not constitute brushing hair. While both actions occur near the head, they are semantically and functionally different, with no significant temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0373_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Right arm curl,1.0,"The prediction 'Right arm curl' is a specific and accurate description of the ground truth action 'bicepcurl', which involves curling the arm (typically with resistance) to exercise the biceps. The prediction correctly identifies the key motion and limb involved, constituting a semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0374_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using a phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile phone."
videos/session_0375_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are not sufficiently aligned to consider them related or temporally overlapping parts of the same action."
videos/session_0376_type.mp4,type,Action: Typing on a laptop,1.0,"The prediction 'Typing on a laptop' is a specific and accurate instantiation of the ground truth action 'type', which refers to the act of inputting text, commonly done via a keyboard or laptop."

videos/session_0379_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Hand Gestures,0.9,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' is a specific hand gesture, and the prediction 'Hand Gestures' correctly identifies the general category of the action. While not exact, it is a semantically appropriate and reasonable interpretation given the low-resolution thermal video input, and it captures the essential nature of the activity."
videos/session_0380_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Hand Gestures,0.9,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' is a specific hand gesture, and the prediction 'Hand Gestures' accurately captures the semantic category of the action. While not exact, it is a correct and reasonable generalization given the visual input constraints."
videos/session_0381_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Hand Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Hand Waving' describes a generic, often back-and-forth or up-and-down motion that lacks the directional precision and circular trajectory required by the ground truth. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0382_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Hand Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Hand Waving' describes a generic, often back-and-forth or random hand movement that lacks the precision and directional intent of drawing a circle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0383_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person mimicking or interacting with a stop sign (e.g., holding up a hand in a stopping gesture), while the predicted action 'Waving' is a distinctly different hand gesture with a different intent and motion pattern. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or contextually overlapping."
videos/session_0384_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between these actions, and 'Drinking' does not represent a plausible part or interpretation of 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0385_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Right Hand Wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing the hand away from the body, likely in interaction with another person or object. The prediction 'Right Hand Wave' describes a waving gesture, which is a different type of hand movement—typically rhythmic and communicative rather than repulsive or resistive. While both involve hand motion, the intent and kinematics are dissimilar, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0386_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Saluting,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'saluting' involve raising an arm, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Saluting is a formal, static gesture typically held briefly, whereas handwaving is a dynamic, repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'saluting' is not a valid temporal part nor a semantic equivalent, but it shares some superficial visual similarity, warranting a low—but not zero—score."
videos/session_0387_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Draw right,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a cleaning motion typically using a broom, while the predicted action 'Draw right' suggests a completely unrelated activity involving drawing or gesturing. There is no semantic overlap, temporal relationship, or contextual plausibility between sweeping and drawing, especially in a thermal video context where fine motor actions like drawing are unlikely to be distinguishable and inconsistent with the sweeping motion."
videos/session_0388_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves rhythmic hand movements, while the predicted action 'Drinking' describes a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0389_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Right Arm Wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a translational body movement, typically involving the whole body moving along a surface or through space (e.g., sliding on the floor, down a slide, or lateral movement). The predicted action 'Right Arm Wave' is a localized upper-body gesture that does not constitute or temporally relate to sliding. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between waving an arm and sliding, making this a nearly complete mismatch."
videos/session_0390_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Right Hand Wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor hand movement, likely involving drawing a zigzag pattern, possibly with the hand moving laterally in a controlled manner. The prediction 'Right Hand Wave' describes a different, more rhythmic and open-hand motion typically used for greeting. While both involve right hand movement, the motion patterns and intent are distinct; waving is not a plausible temporal part or semantic equivalent of drawing a zigzag. Thus, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0391_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Punch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick evasive movement, typically involving lateral or backward motion to avoid something. The predicted action 'punch' is an offensive striking motion, which is semantically and functionally distinct from dodging. While both may occur in similar contexts (e.g., combat sports), they represent opposing intents—avoidance vs. attack—and are not temporal parts or equivalents of each other."
videos/session_0392_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Pick up and throw,0.9,"The predicted action 'Pick up and throw' accurately describes a core component of the bowling motion, which involves picking up a ball and throwing (or rolling) it down a lane. Although not using the exact word 'bowling', the description captures the essential movement and intent of the activity, making it a strong semantic match."
videos/session_0393_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Hand-up,1.0,"The predicted action 'Hand-up' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'liftupahand', describing the same specific movement of raising a hand."
videos/session_0394_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'tap' refers to a brief, light touch or contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0395_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine motor hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or similar precise manipulations. The predicted action 'Throwing' involves a gross motor movement of the arm and hand to propel an object, which is fundamentally different in motion, intent, and body mechanics. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0396_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Two-hand wave,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a precise, controlled hand movement to trace a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'Two-hand wave' is a broad, rhythmic waving motion that does not resemble or temporally align with the specific geometric drawing motion required for 'drawtriangle'. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct."
videos/session_0397_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: coughing,0.7,"Coughing and sneezing are distinct actions, but they are closely related respiratory reflexes with similar visual manifestations in low-resolution thermal video (e.g., sudden upper body movement, head motion). While not semantically equivalent, the prediction is plausible and contextually related, warranting a medium-high score."
videos/session_0398_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between coughing and drinking, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0399_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Forward bend,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty in coordination. The predicted action 'Forward bend' describes a static or controlled bending motion, which is not temporally or semantically related to staggering. It does not represent a plausible phase or variant of staggering, nor is it a related dynamic activity. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0400_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-opening gesture typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different behavior involving holding and consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or categorical overlap between them."
videos/session_0401_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Using inhaler,0.2,"The ground truth action 'blownose' refers to the specific act of blowing one's nose, typically involving a tissue and facial contact. The predicted action 'Using inhaler' describes a different respiratory-related activity that involves inhaling medication through a device. While both actions involve the face and respiration, they are distinct in purpose, motion, and object interaction. This constitutes a semantically different action rather than a temporal phase or valid variant, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0402_strechoneself.mp4,strechoneself,Action: Stretching,1.0,"The prediction 'Stretching' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'strechoneself', which appears to be a typographical variant of 'stretch oneself'. The actions are identical in meaning."
videos/session_0403_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: phone call,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'phone call' implies holding a phone to the ear or face. Although there may be superficial visual similarity in thermal video (e.g., hand near head), these are semantically distinct actions. A phone call does not inherently involve touching the face, and 'touchface' does not imply using a phone. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0404_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0405_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Kiss,0.3,"While both 'hug' and 'kiss' are forms of affectionate human interaction, they are distinct actions with different physical manifestations. A kiss does not constitute a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of hugging, nor is it a plausible partial view of the action 'hug' in a thermal video context. Therefore, the prediction is related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0406_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Pushing,1.0,"The prediction 'Pushing' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'pushsomeone', accurately capturing the core interaction depicted in the label."

videos/session_0408_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Pushing,0.3,"While both 'punchsomeone' and 'pushing' involve physical interaction, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Punching is a rapid, striking motion typically with a closed fist, whereas pushing involves sustained force with open hands or body contact. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, temporally overlapping, or specific instances of a broader category that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0409_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: handshake,0.8,"A handshake is a specific form of social interaction that commonly occurs during a conversation. While not an exact match, it is a semantically related and plausible component of the broader 'conversation' context, especially in thermal video where fine verbal cues are absent and physical interaction may dominate the visual signal."
videos/session_0410_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sit down,1.0,"The prediction 'Sit down' is a direct and semantically equivalent temporal phase of the ground truth action 'sit', fully aligning with the expected behavior for this label."
videos/session_0411_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Turn,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' implies forward locomotion, while the predicted action 'Turn' describes a change in orientation without necessarily involving walking. Although turning can occur during walking, it is not a sufficient or representative part of the 'walk' action on its own, especially in a HAR context where 'walk' is a distinct locomotive activity. Thus, the prediction is largely mismatched."
videos/session_0412_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bowing,1.0,"The prediction 'Bowing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'bow', representing the same human activity."
videos/session_0413_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and the predicted action 'Lying' accurately describes a key and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid component of the sleep action."
videos/session_0414_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Discus Throw,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies rhythmic, expressive body movements typically performed to music. 'Discus Throw' is a specific athletic throwing motion with no meaningful overlap in movement pattern, intent, or context with dancing. The actions are fundamentally different in form and purpose, warranting a very low score."
videos/session_0415_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Punching,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jog' refers to a rhythmic, forward-moving running motion, while the predicted action 'Punching' is an upper-body striking movement with no locomotion. These actions are fundamentally different in both intent and motion pattern, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0416_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Pushup,0.0,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'Pushup' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while lying prone and pushing the body up—completely different in intent, motion, and posture from falling down. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0417_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Pick up,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement, while the predicted action 'Pick up' implies bending or lifting an object from a lower position. These actions are fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0418_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: High throw,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a specific, dynamic full-body exercise involving simultaneous arm and leg movement. The predicted action 'High throw' suggests an upper-body motion focused on throwing something upward, which is not a component or semantic equivalent of jumping jacks. The actions are fundamentally different in form and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0419_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squat,1.0,"The predicted action 'Squat' exactly matches the ground truth action 'squat', both in wording and semantic meaning."
videos/session_0420_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, which is distinct from 'walking'. While both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static, exertive nature of a lunge and instead describes a different, unrelated locomotive activity."
videos/session_0421_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turn,1.0,"The predicted action 'Turn' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'turn', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0422_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching' describes an upright, alternating leg-lifting motion usually performed standing in place. While both involve leg movement, they are biomechanically and contextually distinct activities with different postures and purposes. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0423_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Juggling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'juggling' entails a distinctly different motion pattern—tossing and catching objects—which is not semantically related, temporally overlapping, or a plausible interpretation of airdrumming. The two actions are visually and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0424_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punch,1.0,"The prediction 'Punch' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'. Since boxing primarily involves punching motions, this is a semantically equivalent and specific match."
videos/session_0425_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Looking around,0.3,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers to a specific, deliberate movement of the head from side to side. The prediction 'Looking around' implies eye or head movement to observe surroundings, which is semantically related but not equivalent. However, 'looking around' typically involves more general scanning behavior and does not specifically capture the rhythmic, lateral head motion implied by 'shakehead'. Given the specificity of the ground truth and the lack of clear equivalence or temporal inclusion, this is a weak match at best."
videos/session_0426_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear. The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0427_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, making the prediction a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0428_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0429_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture.

videos/session_0431_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping jacks,0.3,"While both 'jumprope' and 'jumping jacks' involve jumping and are dynamic exercises, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping jacks do not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of jumprope, nor is one a valid instantiation of the other. Therefore, the prediction is related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0432_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Picking up,0.2,"The ground truth action 'moppingfloor' involves a dynamic, repetitive cleaning motion typically performed while standing and moving a mop across the floor. The predicted action 'Picking up' suggests a brief, discrete action of lifting an object, which is not a typical or logical temporal part of mopping. While both may occur in a cleaning context, they represent distinct actions with different motion patterns and intents. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0433_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: head scratching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves using a brush or hand to groom hair, typically with repetitive, deliberate motions near the head. 'Head scratching' is a different behavior—focused on itching rather than grooming—and does not constitute a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing hair. While both involve the head, the intent and motion are distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."

The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same high-level category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0440_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Salute,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which involves a specific hand configuration (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle). The predicted action 'Salute' is a distinctly different hand/arm gesture typically involving raising the hand to the forehead. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and visually dissimilar, with no temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0441_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a peace sign,1.0,"Making a peace sign is semantically equivalent to making a victory sign, as both refer to the same hand gesture (V-sign) commonly used to symbolize peace or victory. The predicted action accurately captures the ground truth label 'makevictorysign'."
videos/session_0442_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: pointing at something,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction.

There is no temporal or conceptual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0443_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'Waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically side-to-side or up-and-down—and does not closely resemble the precise circular motion required. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0444_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Saluting,0.2,"The ground truth 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a traffic or safety context. 'Saluting' is a distinct gesture with different intent and form, and does not reasonably correspond to handling or mimicking a stop sign. The actions are semantically unrelated."

videos/session_0456_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: High Knees,0.3,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise where a person raises their legs while lying down or seated, typically targeting the lower abdomen. The predicted action 'High Knees' involves standing and rapidly lifting knees toward the chest, which is a different dynamic movement pattern. While both are leg-focused exercises, they are distinct in form, posture, and execution, making the prediction incorrect rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0457_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: crossing arms,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, dynamic arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with arms moving in front of the body. The prediction 'crossing arms' describes a static or closed-arm posture that does not resemble the motion pattern or intent of airdrumming. The actions are semantically and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0458_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Draw gun,0.0,"The predicted action 'Draw gun' is completely unrelated to the ground truth 'boxing'. It represents a different semantic category involving weapon handling rather than a combat sport or physical exercise, and does not correspond to any plausible temporal phase or interpretation of boxing."
videos/session_0459_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Turning head,0.9,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' involves lateral or rotational movement of the head, and the predicted action 'Turning head' describes a closely related motion.

videos/session_0465_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Golf Swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'Golf Swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive, sweeping motions close to the ground, typically with a mop, while a golf swing is an overhead or lateral striking motion with a club. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0466_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Applying cream,0.2,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming the hair with a brush or similar tool, while the predicted action 'Applying cream' refers to applying a topical substance, likely to the skin. These are distinct grooming-related activities but involve different objects, motions, and target areas. The actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal phase of the other. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0467_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Putting on hat,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving curling a weight toward the shoulder. The predicted action 'Putting on hat' is a completely unrelated activity with no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap. This constitutes a clear mismatch."

videos/session_0472_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing with the right hand,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is pointed downward, typically indicating disapproval. The predicted action 'Pointing with the right hand' describes a different gesture altogether—likely involving an extended index finger or general pointing motion—and does not correspond to or temporally overlap with the 'thumbdown' gesture. The two actions are semantically and visually distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0473_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Waving Hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which involves a specific static or near-static hand configuration (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle). The prediction 'Waving Hand' describes a distinctly different dynamic hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally unrelated, and waving is not a temporal phase or variant of making the 'OK' sign."
videos/session_0474_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Peace Sign,1.0,"The predicted action 'Peace Sign' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly known as the V-sign or peace sign."
videos/session_0475_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: right arm wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a controlled, circular motion of the arm (likely tracing a clockwise circle), while the prediction 'right arm wave' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down motion. Although both involve arm movement, the motion patterns are distinct and not semantically equivalent or temporally related parts of the same action. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0476_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Hand waving' describes a generic, often back-and-forth or random hand movement that does not capture the precise circular and directional nature of the true action. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0477_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a traffic or instructional context. The predicted action 'Hand wave' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no plausible temporal or categorical relationship between waving and presenting or using a stop sign."
videos/session_0478_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. These actions are semantically unrelated and involve distinct motion patterns and intent. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering 'drinking' as a valid part or interpretation of 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0479_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Stop,0.6,"The ground truth 'pushhandaway' implies a specific gesture of repelling or warding off with the hand, which may resemble a 'stop' gesture in form and intent. While not an exact match, 'Stop' is a semantically related action that could reasonably describe the observed motion in a low-resolution thermal clip, especially if the hand is extended forward. However, it lacks the specificity of 'pushing away,' resulting in a medium score."
videos/session_0480_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand to signal or greet."
videos/session_0481_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'hand waving' describes a different, often social or signaling gesture with distinct motion patterns. Although both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with little overlap in intent or execution. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0484_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Throw,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movement in a controlled manner. The predicted action 'Throw' involves a forceful, ballistic motion that is fundamentally different in intent, motion dynamics, and body mechanics. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0485_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Turning,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a rapid, evasive movement to avoid something, typically involving lateral or sudden directional changes. The prediction 'Turning' describes a rotational motion but lacks the urgency, intent, or evasive nature central to 'dodge'. While turning could be a component of dodging, it is not sufficiently specific or semantically equivalent, and on its own does not capture the core dynamic of the labeled action."
videos/session_0486_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The predicted action 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves the act of throwing a ball. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on semantic similarity rather than exact wording, this prediction accurately captures the essential motion of the activity."
videos/session_0487_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Hand Waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising a hand, which is semantically very close to 'Hand Waving'. While waving typically includes repeated motion, the core action of lifting a hand is present and aligns well with the intent of the label, especially given the low-resolution thermal video context where fine motion details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0488_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the prediction 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture focused on indicating direction or objects. Although both involve hand movements, they serve distinct purposes and are not semantically equivalent or temporally related parts of the same action."
videos/session_0489_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Fist Pump,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Fist Pump' is a gross motor movement involving raising a closed fist, often in celebration. These actions are anatomically and semantically distinct—different hand configurations, motion patterns, and intent. There is no temporal or categorical overlap, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0490_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Arm Wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, controlled arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'Arm Wave' describes a generic, rhythmic waving motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a precise geometric shape. While both involve arm movement, the intent and motion pattern differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0491_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a deliberate, manual activity of consuming liquid.

videos/session_0493_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the key characteristic of instability inherent to 'stagger'. Therefore, the prediction is related but misses a critical semantic distinction, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0494_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves opening the mouth wide due to tiredness or boredom, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different and unrelated behavior. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between yawning and drinking in this context."
videos/session_0495_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, typically with an arm raised to the face.

videos/session_0496_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Torso Twist,0.9,The predicted action 'Torso Twist' is a specific form of stretching that directly falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself'. It represents a valid and semantically consistent instance of the ground truth label.
videos/session_0497_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Salute,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, such as scratching, rubbing, or adjusting glasses. A 'salute' typically involves raising the hand to the forehead but does not inherently imply touching the face in the same manner. While both involve hand-to-head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and form. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0498_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying down' is a valid and highly indicative posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verb match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent. Thus, it qualifies as a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible representation of the action."
videos/session_0499_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0500_hug.mp4,hug,Action: hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0501_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Kicking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' involves direct physical contact where one person exerts force to move another. The predicted action 'Kicking' is a distinctly different aggressive or dynamic motion that does not align semantically or temporally with pushing. While both are active and involve force, they are fundamentally different actions with different intent and mechanics, warranting a low score."

These actions are semantically and behaviorally distinct, with no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern."
videos/session_0504_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Exchanging object,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies verbal or non-verbal social interaction, which may include gestures but not necessarily object exchange. 'Exchanging object' suggests a transactional or physical transfer of an item, which is a distinct activity and not a typical component or temporal phase of conversation. While both involve interaction, the actions are semantically different enough to warrant a low score."

videos/session_0506_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Pick up,1.0,"The prediction 'Pick up' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'pickup', differing only in phrasing (verb form vs. noun form). This constitutes a correct identification of the action."
videos/session_0507_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Making the sign of the cross,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, outward pushing motion with the hand, likely in a defensive or gestural context. The predicted action 'Making the sign of the cross' is a specific religious gesture involving controlled, symbolic hand movements across the body, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from pushing a hand away. There is minimal overlap in intent, motion pattern, or context, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0508_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."
videos/session_0509_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Hand on hip,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' implies a dynamic cleaning motion involving arm movement across a surface, while the prediction 'Hand on hip' describes a static pose unrelated to sweeping.

The prediction 'Arm Cross' describes a different, static or repetitive crossing motion that does not resemble the dynamic, directional nature of drawing a zigzag. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0513_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Swinging,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement to avoid something, while the predicted action 'swinging' suggests a broad, arcing motion (e.g., of an arm or object). These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct—dodging typically involves lateral or backward body shifts, whereas swinging involves rotational or pendular motion. There is no strong temporal or categorical overlap, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0514_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throw,0.9,"The predicted action 'Throw' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves throwing or rolling a ball toward pins. Given the temporal and semantic alignment, this is a highly accurate prediction."
videos/session_0515_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Hand Waving,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising one or both hands, which is semantically very close to 'Hand Waving'. While waving typically implies repetitive motion, in the context of a short thermal clip, a single upward hand movement could reasonably be interpreted as waving. The actions share the core element of deliberate hand elevation, making this a strong semantic match."
videos/session_0516_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'tap' refers to a brief, light touch or contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent.

Although both are dynamic lower-body actions and may appear somewhat similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are distinct exercises with different biomechanics and intent. The prediction is not a temporal phase of a lunge nor a semantic equivalent, placing it in the low-to-mid similarity range; however, given the specificity of 'lunge' as a defined exercise, the mismatch warrants a low score."
videos/session_0544_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turn,1.0,"The predicted action 'Turn' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'turn', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0545_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Donkey Kicks,0.6,"Both 'pushup' and 'donkey kicks' are specific calisthenic exercises typically performed during a workout, making them semantically related under a broader 'exercise' or 'gym' category. However, they are distinct movements with different biomechanics—pushups primarily involve upper body pushing while donkey kicks target the glutes and hips. Since the ground truth is a precise action ('pushup') and the prediction is a different but plausible exercise, this falls into the medium score range due to relatedness without direct equivalence or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0546_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: High knees,0.3,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise where a person raises their legs while lying down or seated, typically targeting core muscles.

videos/session_0567_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'Waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically a back-and-forth or up-and-down motion—and does not align with the circular, directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0568_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving hand,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose.

videos/session_0576_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in direction or body orientation. The prediction 'turning' is related, as turning can be part of a dodging motion, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the evasive or reactive nature of 'dodge'. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap."
videos/session_0577_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding and swinging a ball toward pins. 'Pick up' could be a minor component (e.g., picking up a bowling ball), but it is too generic and does not capture the core or characteristic motion of bowling. Without clear evidence that the clip shows the act of picking up the ball as part of a bowling sequence, this prediction is only weakly related and overly vague."

The predicted action 'salute' is a distinct gesture involving a single hand raised to the forehead in a formal or military context. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and spatial location, making them semantically unrelated. There is no plausible temporal or contextual overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0722_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: pick up,0.6,"The ground truth 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving lifting a weight toward the shoulder. The prediction 'pick up' is related in that it involves lifting, but it is less specific and could refer to a wide range of actions (e.g., picking up an object from the floor). While not an exact match or a clear temporal phase of a bicep curl, it is plausibly associated with lifting motion, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0723_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using cellphone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using cellphone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile phone."
videos/session_0724_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) and is semantically distinct. While both involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are functionally and contextually different activities with little overlap in intent or execution. Therefore, this is considered a nearly incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0725_type.mp4,type,Action: Typing,1.0,"The prediction 'Typing' is a direct and exact match for the ground truth action 'type', as both refer to the same activity of inputting text on a keyboard."
videos/session_0726_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Thumbs up / Thumbs down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' is a specific gesture, and the prediction 'Thumbs up / Thumbs down' includes 'Thumbs up' as a direct match. The inclusion of 'Thumbs down' introduces slight ambiguity but does not negate the correct identification of the intended gesture, especially given the low-resolution thermal input which may limit fine-grained distinction."
videos/session_0727_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Waving' describes a different hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling.

The predicted action 'hand waving' describes a different, broader hand motion that does not correspond to forming the OK sign. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intent and form, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0729_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a peace sign,1.0,"Making a peace sign is semantically equivalent to making a victory sign, as both refer to the same hand gesture (V-sign) commonly used interchangeably in everyday contexts."
videos/session_0730_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Arm Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular motion of the arm, likely in front of the body. 'Arm waving' is a vague and unstructured movement that does not capture the intentional, circular trajectory required by the ground truth. While both involve arm motion, the lack of specificity and directional intent makes this only loosely related, falling into the low-to-medium overlap range; however, given the clear mismatch in motion pattern, it is scored as low."
videos/session_0731_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically side-to-side or up-and-down hand motion that does not match the directional and repetitive circular nature of drawing a counterclockwise circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0732_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving Hand,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person mimicking or holding a stop sign gesture (typically an open palm raised forward), which is a static or deliberate signaling pose. The predicted action 'Waving Hand' involves a dynamic, side-to-side or up-and-down hand motion, which is semantically and functionally distinct from a stop sign gesture. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."

videos/session_0734_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Signalling,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a specific physical gesture of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The prediction 'Signalling' suggests a communicative gesture (e.g., waving or gesturing to convey information), which is semantically different in intent and motion. While both involve hand movement, they serve distinct purposes and are not temporally or functionally related. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated (e.g., both are upper-body gestures), warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0735_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Tossing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a person deliberately moving their hand in a waving motion, typically for greeting or signaling. The predicted action 'Tossing' implies throwing an object, which is a fundamentally different motion involving arm movement but with a distinct purpose and trajectory.

videos/session_0740_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Turning,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a rapid, evasive movement to avoid something, typically involving lateral or sudden directional shifts. The prediction 'Turning' describes a rotational motion but lacks the urgency, intent, or evasive nature central to 'dodge'. While turning could be a component of dodging, it is not sufficiently specific or semantically equivalent, and on its own does not capture the core dynamic of the labeled action."

videos/session_0742_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Pointing finger,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' implies raising a hand, which is semantically very close to 'pointing finger'—a specific instance of lifting or extending a hand. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of the label, this prediction captures a plausible and specific manifestation of the intended action."
videos/session_0743_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Hand Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while 'hand waving' is a distinct, broader arm motion typically used for greeting or signaling. Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically different actions with different intent and motion patterns. Hand waving is not a temporal part nor a plausible variant of tapping."
videos/session_0744_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine motor hand gesture involving spreading and pinching fingers, likely in a controlled or deliberate manner.

videos/session_0751_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Jumping Jacks,0.6,"Both 'stretchoneself' and 'Jumping Jacks' are forms of physical exercise involving dynamic body movement. While Jumping Jacks are more vigorous and rhythmic, they do involve stretching of arms and legs, making them loosely related to stretching. However, 'stretchoneself' typically implies slower, deliberate elongation of muscles, which is not fully captured by 'Jumping Jacks'. Thus, the prediction is related but not a precise match or a clear temporal part of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0752_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their face, which is distinct from 'smoking'. While both may involve hand-to-face motion, smoking implies a specific context (holding and inhaling from a cigarette) that is not equivalent to or a temporal part of touching one's face.

videos/session_0808_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.6,"Coughing and sneezing are both respiratory reflex actions that share visual similarities in thermal video (e.g., sudden head/upper body motion, possible hand-to-face gesture). While not the same action, they are closely related and may be difficult to distinguish in low-resolution thermal footage. This warrants a medium score due to plausible but incorrect specificity."
videos/session_0809_cough.mp4,cough,Action: make a sign of the cross,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'make a sign of the cross' is a deliberate religious gesture involving hand and arm movements. These actions are anatomically, functionally, and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them equivalent or related."
videos/session_0810_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Turning,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often with loss of balance. The prediction 'Turning' describes a controlled rotational motion and does not capture the instability or gait disturbance inherent to staggering. These actions are semantically distinct, with no clear temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0811_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies holding and consuming a liquid. These are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap. Drinking is not a plausible part of yawning, nor are they related under any abstract category in this context."
videos/session_0812_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Take off mask,0.1,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a specific facial gesture using a tissue or hand near the nose, while the predicted action 'Take off mask' describes a different upper-face interaction. Although both involve hand-to-face motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution. There is minimal overlap, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0813_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Cheering,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' refers to a person actively extending or flexing their body, typically in a controlled and deliberate manner. The predicted action 'Cheering' involves expressive, often rhythmic arm movements and vocalization, which is semantically and physically distinct from stretching. While both may involve arm motion, they serve different purposes and exhibit different movement patterns. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0814_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Coughing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves deliberate contact with the face, while 'coughing' is a respiratory reflex that may or may not involve touching the face. Although coughing sometimes includes covering the mouth, it is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal phase of 'touchface'. The actions are functionally distinct, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0815_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'handshake' exactly matches the ground truth action 'handshake', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0816_hug.mp4,hug,Action: hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0817_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Pushing,1.0,"The prediction 'Pushing' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'pushsomeone', accurately capturing the core interaction depicted in the thermal video clip."
videos/session_0818_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kick Leg,0.9,"The ground truth 'kicksomeone' implies an aggressive kicking motion directed at another person. The prediction 'Kick Leg' captures the core physical action (kicking) accurately, though it omits the interpersonal context ('someone'). Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video, which may obscure interaction details, the predicted action is a semantically valid and specific representation of the essential movement in the ground truth."
videos/session_0819_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Pushing,0.3,"While both 'punchsomeone' and 'pushing' involve physical interaction, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Punching is a rapid, striking motion typically with a closed fist, whereas pushing involves sustained force with open hands or body contact. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is pushing a typical temporal phase of punching. Thus, the prediction is partially related but significantly mismatched."
videos/session_0820_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Walking around,0.1,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies social interaction, typically involving people facing each other and remaining relatively stationary. The predicted action 'Walking around' describes locomotion without any indication of interaction, which is semantically unrelated to conversation. While thermal videos may obscure fine details, walking around is not a plausible temporal part or specific instance of conversing, nor is it a related or ambiguous interaction in this context."
videos/session_0821_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and somewhat generic compared to typical gym-focused actions like weightlifting or using equipment. It falls into the medium score range as a related but not strongly indicative action."
videos/session_0822_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing any self-chosen active movement, typically dynamic in nature. The prediction 'Drinking' describes a specific, non-exercise-related activity that does not fall under the broad category of voluntary physical actions implied by 'freestyle'. It is a completely different and unrelated action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0823_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking in place,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking in place' is a specific, plausible exercise that aligns with typical gym-related movements, making it a valid and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0824_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Turn and walk,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice.

The predicted action 'opening a bottle' is a specific, plausible activity that falls within the broad scope of 'freestyle', making it a valid match."
videos/session_0829_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Marching,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various physical activities. 'Marching' is a specific, dynamic exercise that reasonably falls under the 'gym' category, making it a valid and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0830_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Golf Swing,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. A 'Golf Swing' is a specific, valid action that falls under this open-ended category, making the prediction correct."
videos/session_0831_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and not strongly indicative of typical gym-focused activities like weightlifting or cardio machines. It falls into a related but somewhat generic category, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0832_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: walking,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walking' is a valid, specific action that falls under this abstract label, making the prediction correct."
videos/session_0833_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Dancing,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, physically active movement that reasonably falls under the broad interpretation of 'gym' in this context, especially since 'freestyle' (as noted in constraints) allows for any self-chosen action. Thus, the prediction is semantically appropriate."
videos/session_0834_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Walking,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walking' is a valid, specific action that falls under this abstract label, making the prediction correct."
videos/session_0835_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Tying shoes,0.2,"The ground truth 'gym' implies active physical exercise, while 'tying shoes' is a preparatory or static activity unrelated to the core concept of gym-based exertion. Although tying shoes might occur before a workout, it does not represent a valid instance or component of the 'gym' activity as defined in the context."
videos/session_0836_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Toss,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any arbitrary action. 'Toss' is a specific, plausible dynamic action that falls within the scope of freestyle behavior, making it a valid and reasonable prediction."
videos/session_0837_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and somewhat generic compared to typical gym-centric actions like weightlifting or using equipment. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but not strongly indicative action."
videos/session_0838_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Turning,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any arbitrary action. 'Turning' is a specific, plausible movement that falls within the scope of freestyle activity, making it a valid and reasonable prediction."
videos/session_0839_sit.mp4,sit,"Action: Sit down, stand up",1.0,"The prediction 'Sit down, stand up' includes actions that are direct temporal components of the ground truth label 'sit'. Both sitting down and standing up are logically associated with the act of sitting, especially in a short video clip where transitions are common."
videos/session_0840_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Turn,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' implies forward locomotion, while the predicted action 'Turn' describes a change in orientation without necessarily involving walking. Although turning can occur during walking, it is not a core or defining part of the 'walk' action, nor is it semantically equivalent or a logical temporal phase (like starting or stopping to walk). Thus, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0841_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bowing,1.0,"The prediction 'Bowing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'bow', representing the same human activity."
videos/session_0842_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves a person lying down, and 'lying' is a core and necessary posture for sleeping. While 'lying' alone doesn't guarantee the person is asleep, in the context of thermal video where fine details like eye closure aren't visible, predicting 'lying' is a semantically appropriate and highly indicative proxy for 'sleep'. Thus, it qualifies as a correct and high-scoring prediction."
videos/session_0843_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Cheering,0.6,"Cheering often involves dynamic, rhythmic upper-body movements and can overlap with expressive physical actions like dancing, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details are ambiguous. While not a direct match, it is a related expressive activity that shares energetic and gestural qualities with 'dance', placing it in the medium-similarity range."
videos/session_0844_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0845_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Sitting down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies an uncontrolled, sudden loss of balance or collapse, whereas 'sitting down' is a controlled, deliberate movement. Although both involve lowering the body, they are semantically and physically distinct in intent and execution. Therefore, the prediction does not match the ground truth action."
videos/session_0846_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Boxing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a distinct, dynamic movement involving both feet leaving the ground. 'Boxing' involves upper-body striking motions and typically does not include jumping as a defining characteristic. While both are active movements, they are semantically and kinematically different actions with little overlap in core motion patterns. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0847_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Standing still,0.1,"The ground truth label 'gym' implies dynamic physical activity, while the prediction 'Standing still' describes a static, inactive state. According to the evaluation criteria, generic static descriptions for clearly dynamic abstract labels like 'gym' should receive a low score."
videos/session_0848_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: sitting down,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Sitting down' is a valid, specific human action and falls within the broad scope of freestyle behavior, making it a semantically acceptable prediction."
videos/session_0849_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Hand clapping,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. Hand clapping, while not a typical gym exercise, is an active movement that could reasonably occur in a gym context (e.g., as part of a warm-up, coordination drill, or rhythmic exercise). Given the allowance for any specific active movement under 'gym', this prediction is considered a valid instance."
videos/session_0850_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: walking,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walking' is a valid, specific action that falls under this abstract category, making the prediction correct and reasonably specific."
videos/session_0851_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Waving hands,0.3,"The ground truth 'gym' implies dynamic physical activity such as exercising or weightlifting. 'Waving hands' is a mild, non-exercise gesture that does not align with typical gym-related actions and lacks the intensity or intent associated with the 'gym' label."
videos/session_0852_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: sitting down,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Sitting down' is a valid, specific action that falls within the broad scope of freestyle behavior, and is not a generic static description. Therefore, it is semantically consistent with the abstract label."

videos/session_0860_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Dance,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific, controlled exercise movement involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'Dance' describes a broad, rhythmic, and often full-body activity that is not semantically equivalent nor a plausible temporal part of a legraise. While both are dynamic, they belong to different activity categories with distinct motion patterns, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0861_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Bicep Curl,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The prediction 'Bicep Curl' is a specific strength-training exercise with a different motion pattern and intent. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no significant overlap in form or purpose. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0863_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, and 'Standing' fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of 'shakehead'."
videos/session_0864_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Phone Call,1.0,"The prediction 'Phone Call' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone to communicate."
videos/session_0865_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they are distinct actions with different motions and purposes. The ground truth 'eat' specifically refers to consuming solid food, whereas 'drinking' involves liquids. Given the clarity of the label 'eat', predicting 'drinking' constitutes a different action rather than a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0874_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The prediction 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing teeth. While both involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are distinct activities with different intent and context, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0875_type.mp4,type,Action: using phone,0.2,"The ground truth action 'type' implies using a keyboard or similar device to input text, while the predicted action 'using phone' suggests interacting with a mobile device. Although both involve hand-based interaction with electronic devices, they are distinct activities in the context of HAR—typing typically involves a stationary posture with focused finger movements on a keyboard, whereas using a phone often includes different gestures and postures. The actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal part of the other, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0876_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Cross arms,0.0,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is raised, while the predicted action 'Cross arms' describes a completely different upper-body posture involving both arms folded across the chest.

Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and form. The prediction does not capture the specific gesture implied by the ground truth, nor is waving a logical temporal part of making a victory sign."
videos/session_0880_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Hand waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or random hand movement that does not match the precise nature or intent of drawing a circle. While both involve hand motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0881_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Hand wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'Hand wave' is a different gesture altogether—typically a back-and-forth or up-and-down motion used for greeting—and does not resemble the continuous, circular trajectory required by the ground truth. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0882_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or presenting a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling posture. 'Hand waving' is a distinctly different gesture with different intent and motion pattern, and does not correspond to any plausible temporal or semantic interpretation of 'stopsign'."
videos/session_0883_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Punch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a motion where the person pulls their hand inward, likely toward their body. The prediction 'Punch' implies an outward, forceful extension of the arm, which is biomechanically and semantically opposite to pulling in. This constitutes a fundamentally different action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0884_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving pushing hands away, likely in a defensive or repelling motion.

There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0885_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Salute,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'salute' involve arm movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and form. A salute is a specific gesture typically directed upward with a rigid hand posture, whereas handwaving is a lateral or outward motion used for greeting or signaling. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'salute' is not a temporal phase nor a semantic equivalent, but a different gesture altogether."
videos/session_0886_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'hand waving' describes a different, often social or signaling gesture with distinct motion patterns. Although both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with little overlap in intent or execution. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

The predicted action 'Nazi salute' describes a specific, static arm gesture with no relation to drawing or zigzag motion. The two actions are semantically and kinematically unrelated, constituting a complete mismatch."
videos/session_0890_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Throwing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick evasive movement, typically involving lateral or sudden shifts in body position to avoid something. The predicted action 'Throwing' involves a forward-directed motion primarily of the arm and is semantically distinct from dodging. While both are dynamic actions, they serve different purposes and involve different movement patterns, making them largely unrelated in this context."
videos/session_0891_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding and swinging a ball toward pins. 'Pick up' could be a minor preparatory step (e.g., picking up a bowling ball), but it is too generic and does not capture the core dynamic motion of bowling. Without clear evidence that the clip shows the distinctive arm swing or release phase, this prediction is only weakly related and overly vague, falling into the low-score range."
videos/session_0892_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Raise hand,1.0,"The predicted action 'Raise hand' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'liftupahand', differing only in phrasing but describing the same physical movement."
videos/session_0893_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Check watch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the prediction 'Check watch' describes a distinct, goal-oriented behavior that may involve tapping but is not semantically equivalent or a temporal part of 'tap'. The actions are related only loosely at best, and 'check watch' is more specific and contextually different from the generic 'tap' label."
videos/session_0894_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Punch,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or similar precise manipulations. The predicted action 'Punch' is a gross motor movement involving a forceful forward strike with a closed fist. These actions are anatomically and functionally dissimilar—'punch' involves arm extension and aggression or impact, while 'spreadandpinch' is a subtle, controlled hand motion. There is no temporal or semantic overlap, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0895_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Right Arm Draw,0.9,"The ground truth 'drawtriangle' implies a specific drawing motion, likely with the arm. The prediction 'Right Arm Draw' captures the essential action (drawing) and specifies the limb used, which aligns well with the expected behavior.

The predicted action 'bend' refers to a controlled forward or downward motion of the body, which is a distinct and more deliberate movement. While both involve body motion, 'bend' does not capture the instability or locomotion aspect central to 'stagger', making it a semantically different action."
videos/session_0899_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves opening the mouth wide and inhaling deeply, typically associated with tiredness. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different behavior with distinct motion patterns (e.g., tilting head back, hand-to-mouth movement). There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between yawning and drinking in this context."
videos/session_0900_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is visually and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0901_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Two-hand wave,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' implies a deliberate extension or flexing of the body, often involving arms, legs, or torso. The predicted action 'Two-hand wave' is a distinct communicative gesture that does not constitute stretching, nor is it a typical temporal phase or semantic equivalent of stretching. While both involve arm movement, the intent and motion pattern differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0902_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'Drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth. Although both may involve hand-to-head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution. Drinking is not a temporal phase or reasonable interpretation of 'touchface', nor are they related under any abstract category. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0903_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Golf swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'Golf swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive, sweeping motions close to the ground, typically with a mop, while a golf swing is an overhead or lateral striking motion with a club. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0904_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Rub head,0.9,"The predicted action 'Rub head' is semantically very close to 'brushhair', as both involve touching or manipulating the hair with the hand. While not an exact lexical match, the actions are functionally similar in the context of thermal video where fine details may be ambiguous, and 'rubbing the head' can reasonably represent the act of brushing hair."
videos/session_0905_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Putting on hat,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Putting on hat' is a completely unrelated activity involving head and hand coordination, with no semantic or temporal overlap with a bicep curl. This constitutes a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0906_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile phone."
videos/session_0907_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0908_type.mp4,type,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Eating' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible interpretation under which eating constitutes typing or a phase of it."

There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0912_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a phone call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' involves a specific hand gesture (typically raising the hand with index and middle fingers extended in a V shape), while the predicted action 'Making a phone call' describes a completely different hand-to-head gesture. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Waving arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular motion of the arm (likely in front of the body), while the prediction 'waving arm' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down motion. Although both involve arm movement, the motion patterns are distinct and not semantically equivalent or temporally related parts of the same action."
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. While both may involve arm movement, pointing lacks the rotational trajectory essential to drawing a circle, making it a largely incorrect interpretation."
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or presenting a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The prediction 'Hand waving' describes a distinctly different dynamic gesture unrelated to displaying a stop sign. There is no semantic equivalence, temporal overlap, or contextual alignment between the two actions."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Phone Call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward (e.g., mimicking rowing or resistance exercise), while the predicted action 'Phone Call' implies holding a phone to the ear—a completely different and unrelated gesture. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Draw,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or pushing someone's hand away. The predicted action 'Draw' is semantically unrelated—it typically refers to sketching or pulling something, neither of which aligns with the intent or motion of 'pushhandaway'. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0918_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Reaching up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a deliberate, repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand, typically for greeting or signaling. The prediction 'Reaching up' describes a different upper-body movement focused on extending the arm upward, which lacks the characteristic waving motion. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns, making this a partial but insufficient match."
videos/session_0919_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Phone Call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a dynamic, repetitive arm motion typically associated with cleaning, while the predicted action 'Phone Call' implies holding a phone and communicating—actions that are visually and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between sweeping and making a phone call, especially in a thermal video where object details (like a phone) are unlikely to be discernible. This constitutes a completely different action."
videos/session_0920_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0921_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Hand Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, full-body movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, whereas the predicted action 'Hand Waving' is an upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding. The two actions are fundamentally different in motion type, body involvement, and intent, warranting a very low score."
videos/session_0922_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve the repetitive, angular motion characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand use, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0923_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Turn,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position or direction. The prediction 'Turn' describes a change in orientation, which may be part of a dodging motion but is not specific or dynamic enough to fully capture the intent of evasion. While related, it lacks the urgency or lateral/avoidant nature typically associated with dodging, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0924_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Pick up,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence including holding and swinging a ball toward pins. 'Pick up' is only a minor, non-diagnostic component that could apply to many unrelated actions. It lacks the specificity or semantic equivalence needed for a higher score and does not capture the core dynamic of bowling."
videos/session_0925_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Right Arm Lift,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' refers to raising a hand, and the prediction 'Right Arm Lift' accurately describes this action with minor variation in phrasing and specificity (specifying 'right' arm). This is a semantic equivalent and matches the intended movement."
videos/session_0926_tap.mp4,tap,Action: shoot gun,0.1,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'shoot gun' describes a completely different and unrelated behavior involving weapon use. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0927_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Punch,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Punch' is a forceful, aggressive arm movement that is semantically and kinematically unrelated to the delicate, localized hand motion described by the ground truth. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0928_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion to trace or form a triangle shape, likely involving controlled arm movements. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing shapes or triangular motions. While both may involve arm movement, pointing lacks the specific spatial trajectory and intent of drawing a triangle, making it a largely incorrect interpretation."
videos/session_0929_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Sneeze,1.0,"The predicted action 'Sneeze' exactly matches the ground truth action 'sneeze', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."

videos/session_0931_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Bowing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often due to imbalance or impairment. 'Bowing' is a controlled, deliberate gesture involving bending at the waist, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from staggering. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0932_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouth inhalation typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different and unrelated behavior. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between yawning and drinking, and neither is a plausible part of the other."
videos/session_0933_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.2,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and motion patterns. Blowing one's nose typically involves hand-to-face contact and a brief, deliberate motion, whereas coughing is a reflexive torso/head movement without hand involvement. Given the specificity of the ground truth label and the lack of overlap in core action semantics, this is considered a mostly incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0934_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Bending backward,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending backward' is a specific and plausible movement that falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself', which involves extending or flexing the body to stretch muscles. This is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid instance of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0935_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Coughing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves deliberate contact with the face, while 'coughing' is a respiratory reflex that may or may not involve touching the face. Although coughing sometimes includes covering the mouth, it is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal phase of 'touchface'. The actions are functionally distinct, leading to a low score."

videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Pushing,0.3,"While both 'kicksomeone' and 'pushing' involve physical interaction, they represent distinct types of forceful actions—kicking is a lower-body strike, whereas pushing typically involves upper-body contact. The actions are related in being aggressive or interactive but are not semantically equivalent, temporally overlapping phases, or specific instances of a broader category. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Dodge,0.2,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an offensive, direct physical strike toward another person. The predicted action 'Dodge' describes a defensive evasion maneuver, which is functionally and semantically opposite in intent and motion. While both may occur in a combat context, they are not temporally related phases of the same action nor semantically equivalent. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0970_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Handing over an item,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies a social interaction typically involving talking and listening, possibly with gestures, but not necessarily object exchange. 'Handing over an item' suggests a transactional or transfer action, which is not a core component or typical temporal phase of conversation. While both involve interpersonal interaction, the predicted action is too specific and misaligned with the communicative nature of 'conversation', warranting a low score."
videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Marching,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Marching' is a specific, dynamic exercise that reasonably falls under the 'gym' category, making it a valid and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Turning,0.3,"The ground truth 'gym' implies active physical exercise, which includes a range of dynamic movements like lifting, jumping, or stretching. 'Turning' is a very generic and minimal motion that does not sufficiently convey engagement in gym-related activity. While turning could occur during a gym session, it is too vague and static-like to be considered a valid representative action for the 'gym' label, especially when more descriptive actions are expected for such an abstract but dynamic category."
