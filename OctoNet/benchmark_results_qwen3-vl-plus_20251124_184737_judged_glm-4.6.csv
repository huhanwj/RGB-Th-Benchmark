videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.3,"The VLM predicted 'Waving' while the ground truth is 'airdrum'. Although both involve hand movements, the intent and context of the actions are different. 'Airdrum' mimics playing drums, which is a specific rhythmic motion, whereas 'waving' is a general greeting or signaling gesture.
