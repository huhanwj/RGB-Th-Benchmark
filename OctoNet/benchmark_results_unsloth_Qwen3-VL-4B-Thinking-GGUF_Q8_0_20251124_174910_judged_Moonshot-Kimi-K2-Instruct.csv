videos/session_0903_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.9,"'Sweeping' and 'mopping the floor' are semantically very close cleaning activities that differ mainly in the tool used (broom vs. mop). In low-resolution thermal video the motions are nearly indistinguishable, so the prediction is treated as a correct, specific cleaning action."
videos/session_0904_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.8,"'Touching head' is a direct, accurate description of the physical motion involved in brushing hair, making it semantically equivalent to the ground truth action."
videos/session_0905_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: picking up,0.75,"'Picking up' is not identical to 'bicepcurl', but the motion of curling a weight up from a lowered position is essentially a controlled pick-up motion. The prediction captures the core lifting aspect of a bicep curl, making it a closely related and acceptable description."
videos/session_0906_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using a mobile device,1.0,'Using a mobile device' is a direct semantic equivalent of 'playphone'—both describe the same action of interacting with a phone.

videos/session_0912_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Clapping,0.0,Clapping and making a victory sign are two distinct hand gestures with no semantic overlap; they are completely different actions.
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Salute,0.0,'Salute' is a completely different gesture from 'drawcircleclockwise'; there is no semantic or temporal overlap between saluting and drawing a clockwise circle.
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"'Waving' is an arm gesture that involves side-to-side or up-and-down motion, whereas 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' is a specific circular motion in the opposite direction. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"'stopsign' implies the person is performing the gesture of a traffic stop sign (raising a flat hand), whereas 'waving' is a greeting gesture with a different motion. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: taking a photo,0.0,'Taking a photo' is a completely different action from 'pullhandin' (pulling hand inward); no semantic or temporal overlap exists.
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.25,"'Pointing' is a different gesture from 'pushing hand away'; while both involve arm movement, the intent and motion direction differ, making the prediction only weakly related."
videos/session_0918_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: raise arm,0.9,"Raising an arm is the core motion of a handwave; the VLM simply described the movement more literally rather than naming the gesture, so it is semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0919_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"Waving and sweeping are distinct arm motions; waving is a greeting gesture while sweeping involves a pushing/pulling motion to clean. They are not semantically equivalent, nor is waving a temporal part of sweeping, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0920_clap.mp4,clap,Action: waving,0.3,"Clapping and waving are both arm/hand gestures, but they are distinct actions. The prediction is not a temporal part of clapping, nor is it semantically equivalent, so it falls into the low-score category."

videos/session_0925_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.8,"'Pointing' is a specific instance of lifting up a hand, so the predicted action is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'liftupahand'."
videos/session_0926_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.3,"'Waving' and 'tap' are both arm-hand motions, but they are distinct actions; waving is a broad, repetitive gesture while tapping is a short, targeted contact motion. The prediction is only loosely related and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'tap'."
videos/session_0927_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a single-finger gesture, whereas 'spreadandpinch' involves opening the hand wide and then bringing fingers together. The two actions are fundamentally different and not semantically related."
videos/session_0928_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a very different motion from 'drawing a triangle'; the former is a simple directional gesture while the latter involves a specific continuous drawing motion. They are not semantically equivalent, nor is pointing a temporal part of drawing a triangle."

videos/session_0930_cough.mp4,cough,Action: drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'coughing' are distinct actions with no semantic overlap; drinking is an intentional ingestion activity while coughing is an involuntary respiratory reflex. The prediction does not match the ground truth in any temporal or contextual sense.
videos/session_0931_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.4,"'Walking' is a controlled, steady gait, whereas 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular steps. The actions are related (both are forms of locomotion) but the prediction misses the key unsteadiness that defines 'stagger', making it only partially correct."
videos/session_0932_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'yawn' are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap; the VLM predicted a completely unrelated activity.
videos/session_0933_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: talking,0.0,"'Talking' is unrelated to 'blownose'; the two actions involve different body parts and purposes, so the prediction is completely off."
videos/session_0934_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: throwing,0.0,"'Stretching oneself' involves slow, controlled limb or torso movements to elongate muscles, whereas 'throwing' is a rapid ballistic motion to propel an object. These actions are fundamentally different in purpose, motion pattern, and body posture, so the prediction is completely unrelated to the ground truth."

videos/session_0938_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: patting the shoulder,0.7,"'Patting the shoulder' is a gentle, non-aggressive form of physical contact that is semantically close to 'pushing someone'—both involve a hand-to-body interaction with similar motion. While not identical, the predicted action captures the essence of a brief, directed physical contact, making it a related but less specific match."
videos/session_0939_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: handshake,0.0,"'Handshake' is a friendly greeting gesture, whereas 'kicksomeone' is an aggressive striking action; they are semantically unrelated and physically opposite."
videos/session_0940_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: pointing,0.2,"Pointing is a completely different motion from punching; it lacks the striking intent and physical action required by 'punchsomeone', so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0941_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: handshake,0.7,"A handshake is a common, specific gesture that occurs within the broader context of a conversation. While not an exact match, it is a plausible and related action that typically accompanies talking with someone, so it falls in the medium-high range."
