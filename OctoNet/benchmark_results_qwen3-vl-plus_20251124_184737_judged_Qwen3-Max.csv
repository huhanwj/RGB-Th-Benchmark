videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sit,1.0,"The predicted action 'sit' exactly matches the ground truth action 'sit', satisfying the criteria for a high score."
videos/session_0002_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'Bending' captures the core physical motion of bowing, even if it lacks the contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity, this is a semantically appropriate match."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and 'lying down' is a core and necessary component of sleeping. While not an exact synonym, it is a highly accurate semantic proxy in the context of human activity recognition from thermal video, where fine-grained distinctions may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction closely matches the intended activity."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: raise both arms,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. The prediction 'raise both arms' describes a specific motion that could plausibly occur during dancing, but it is not sufficiently indicative of dancing on its own—it could also occur in other contexts (e.g., stretching, signaling). Thus, it is related and plausible but lacks the specificity or contextual richness to be considered a strong match."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Running,1.0,"The predicted action 'Running' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'jog', as both describe similar forms of locomotion at a moderate to fast pace. In common usage and HAR contexts, 'jog' and 'run' are often used interchangeably or represent points on a continuum of the same activity."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: fall,1.0,"The prediction 'fall' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', as both describe the same core event of a person losing balance and collapsing downward."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'throwing' involves primarily upper-body motion and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between jumping and throwing, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jump rope,0.3,"While both 'jumping jack' and 'jump rope' are dynamic, rhythmic exercises involving jumping, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping jacks involve simultaneous arm and leg abduction/adduction, whereas jump rope involves rotating a rope and hopping in place. The VLM's prediction is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or a valid instance of the ground truth label, but it is loosely related as a form of aerobic exercise—hence a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: squat,1.0,"The predicted action 'squat' exactly matches the ground truth action 'squat', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Step,0.6,"A 'lunge' involves a stepping motion as a core component, so predicting 'Step' captures a key element of the action. However, 'Step' is more generic and does not fully convey the specific bending and weight-shift characteristic of a lunge. This makes the prediction related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The prediction 'turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', representing the same activity with only minor phrasing difference."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: crawling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise performed in a prone position, while the predicted action 'crawling' involves forward motion on hands and knees or elbows. Although both involve being low to the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. There is no significant semantic overlap or temporal relationship that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'Walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible interpretation under which walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to a legraise."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: adjusting face covering,0.0,"The ground truth action 'boxing' is a dynamic, high-energy activity involving punching and movement, while the predicted action 'adjusting face covering' is a static, unrelated gesture with no semantic or temporal overlap. This constitutes a completely different action."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: looking around,0.3,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers to a specific, deliberate lateral or vertical head movement, typically indicating 'no' or 'yes'. The prediction 'looking around' implies eye or head motion scanning the environment, which is semantically related but not equivalent. While both involve head motion, 'looking around' lacks the rhythmic, intentional shaking characteristic of 'shakehead', making it a plausible but inaccurate interpretation. Hence, it falls into the low-to-mid range, but closer to low due to the specificity of the GT action."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: making a phone call,1.0,"The prediction 'making a phone call' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for communication."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: covering face,0.3,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves actively moving a hand across the face to clean or dry it, while the prediction 'covering face' implies a static or protective gesture (e.g., hiding or shielding the face). Although both involve the face and hands, the intent and motion are different: wiping is dynamic and directional, whereas covering is typically static or obstructive. This constitutes a related but incorrect interpretation, falling into the low-score range due to the mismatch in action semantics."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bend,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pickup' typically involves bending down to retrieve an object. The predicted action 'bend' is a core and necessary component of the 'pickup' motion, making it a semantically valid and temporally appropriate part of the action."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a dynamic, rhythmic activity involving jumping over a rope, while the predicted action 'Walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with distinct motion patterns. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between walking and jumprope; they are unrelated actions in the context of human activity recognition."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements and intent, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained tool distinctions (mop vs. broom) may not be visible. The predicted action is a plausible and closely related substitute for the ground truth."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person actively grooming their hair, typically with a brush or hand near the head. The predicted action 'talking on the phone' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap—holding a phone to the ear is distinct from brushing hair, even in low-resolution thermal video. There is no plausible interpretation where these actions are equivalent or temporally related."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Waving' involves arm movement but is a distinctly different motion—lateral or outward hand/arm movement for greeting or signaling—and does not resemble the controlled, repetitive curling motion of a bicep curl. The actions are semantically and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: Clapping,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Clapping' is a completely different activity involving hand motion but not related to typing in any semantic, temporal, or categorical sense. There is no overlap or plausible interpretation that would make clapping a valid instance or part of typing."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in phrasing (pluralization and spacing), which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: raise hand,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which involves a specific hand configuration (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle). The prediction 'raise hand' describes a gross motor movement that may accompany the gesture but does not capture the essential fine motor action of forming the sign. While raising the hand could be part of the process, it is not semantically equivalent nor a sufficient temporal part of the specific gesture, making the prediction only loosely related."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: two-finger gesture,1.0,"The prediction 'two-finger gesture' is a clear and accurate description of the 'makevictorysign' action, as the victory sign is commonly represented by a two-finger gesture (index and middle finger raised). This is a semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: raise right arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular motion, likely with an arm or hand. The prediction 'raise right arm' describes a static or linear upward movement, which does not capture the rotational or circular nature of the intended action. While both involve arm movement, the core motion pattern is fundamentally different, making this a low-similarity match."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: raise right arm,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a circular, controlled arm movement, likely with the hand tracing a counter-clockwise path. The prediction 'raise right arm' describes a simple vertical lifting motion, which is neither a temporal part nor a semantic equivalent of drawing a circle. The actions are fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'Waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no indication that waving is a temporal part or valid interpretation of 'stopsign', leading to a very low score."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'waving' involves a distinctly different outward, repetitive hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor part of the same high-level category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion pattern are fundamentally different, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', describing the same human activity with slightly different phrasing."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are visually and semantically dissimilar, especially in a thermal video where contextual cues are limited."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: raise both arms,0.3,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves bringing hands together in front of the body, typically at chest or head height. The prediction 'raise both arms' describes a different motion—lifting arms upward without necessarily bringing hands together. While raising arms might occur as part of initiating a clap, it is not sufficient on its own to constitute clapping and could describe many unrelated actions (e.g., stretching, surrendering). Thus, the prediction is related but misses the defining characteristic of the target action."
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Coughing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' refers to a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'coughing' is an unrelated, non-locomotive physiological action. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing (right hand),0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with a hand or finger. The prediction 'Pointing (right hand)' describes a different hand gesture that does not involve the repetitive, angular motion characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve hand movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position such as leaning, sidestepping, or turning. The prediction 'turning' is a related motion that could plausibly be part of a dodging action, especially in a low-resolution thermal video where fine details are ambiguous. However, 'turning' alone is less specific and may not fully capture the intent or dynamics of 'dodge', placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: picking up an object,0.3,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including holding and swinging a ball toward pins. 'Picking up an object' is only a minor, non-diagnostic component that could occur in many contexts and does not capture the essence or typical motion pattern of bowling. It is too generic and lacks the specificity or semantic alignment required for a higher score."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: raise right arm,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' refers to raising a hand, and the prediction 'raise right arm' is a semantically equivalent and specific description of the same action. The slight difference in wording ('hand' vs 'arm') does not change the core meaning, as lifting the arm typically involves lifting the hand as well, and the action is correctly identified."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Raising hand,0.6,"The ground truth action 'tap' typically involves a light touch or brief contact, often with a finger or hand. The prediction 'Raising hand' is related in that it involves hand movement and could precede or accompany a tap (e.g., raising a hand to tap something), but it does not fully capture the core action of tapping itself. It is a plausible but less specific interpretation, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or fine motor tasks. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion to trace or form a triangle shape, likely involving controlled arm movements. The predicted action 'waving' is a generic, rhythmic hand motion that does not correspond to the geometric precision or intent of drawing a triangle. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: coughing,0.7,"Coughing and sneezing are distinct actions, but they are closely related respiratory reflexes that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of sudden upper-body motion. While not semantically equivalent, the prediction is plausibly confused with the ground truth given the input constraints."
videos/session_0050_cough.mp4,cough,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'drinking' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between coughing and drinking, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' does not capture the distinctive instability inherent to 'staggering', making it a related but significantly different action. Thus, it falls into the low-to-medium overlap range, leaning toward low due to the loss of key semantic nuance."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouth inhalation typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different behavior with distinct motion and intent. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between yawning and drinking."
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.2,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video due to head/upper body motion, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and mechanics. Blowing one's nose typically involves holding a tissue and deliberate nasal clearing, whereas coughing is a reflexive throat/chest action. Given the specificity of the ground truth label and the lack of strong semantic or temporal overlap, this is considered a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a common and specific movement that falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself'. It aligns well with the intent of the ground truth label, which involves self-directed stretching actions, and is not overly generic or unrelated."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth. Although both may involve hand-to-head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution. Drinking does not reasonably encompass or temporally overlap with touching one's face, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0056_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0057_hug.mp4,hug,Action: hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Handshake,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful, directional physical interaction, while the predicted action 'Handshake' describes a consensual, cooperative gesture. These actions are semantically and physically distinct in intent, motion, and social context, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'Kicking' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it accurately captures the core physical action involved."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: spreading arms,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies a directed, aggressive motion toward another person, while the prediction 'spreading arms' describes a neutral or open gesture that lacks the intent, directionality, or motion characteristic of punching. The two actions are semantically and kinematically dissimilar."
videos/session_0061_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: talking,1.0,"The prediction 'talking' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'conversation', as conversation inherently involves talking between individuals."
videos/session_0062_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sitting and standing,1.0,"The prediction 'sitting and standing' includes actions that are logical temporal parts of the ground truth 'sit', such as sitting down or standing up, which are explicitly considered correct under the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0063_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Walking,1.0,The prediction 'Walking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'walk'.
videos/session_0064_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bowing,1.0,"The prediction 'Bowing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'bow', representing the same human activity."
videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying on the ground,0.9,"The prediction 'lying on the ground' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verbal match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action of sleeping in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: raise both arms,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. The prediction 'raise both arms' describes a specific motion that could plausibly occur during dancing, but it is not sufficiently indicative of dancing on its own—it could also occur in many non-dance contexts (e.g., stretching, signaling). Thus, it is related and plausible but lacks the specificity or contextual richness to be considered a strong match."

videos/session_0070_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a core and characteristic component of a jumping jack. While the prediction doesn't capture the full motion (which also includes leg movement), it accurately describes a defining upper-body action of the ground truth 'jumpingjack', making it a highly relevant and semantically aligned partial description."
videos/session_0071_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Shooting a firearm,0.0,"The predicted action 'Shooting a firearm' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'squat'. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions; squatting is a lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees, while shooting a firearm involves upper-body posture and handling a weapon. This constitutes a clear hallucination or misinterpretation."
videos/session_0072_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: lunge,1.0,"The predicted action 'lunge' exactly matches the ground truth action 'lunge', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0073_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turn right,1.0,"The prediction 'turn right' is a specific instance of the ground truth action 'turn', which is semantically equivalent and correctly captures the directional nature of the turning motion."
videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Forward bend,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving lowering and raising the body. The prediction 'Forward bend' typically refers to a standing or seated forward flexion of the torso, which is a different movement pattern and does not align with the mechanics or intent of a pushup. While both involve bending, they are distinct actions with minimal semantic or kinematic overlap."
videos/session_0075_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'legraise' is a dynamic, specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture that does not capture any part of the legraise motion. Given the dynamic nature of 'legraise', a generic static label like 'Standing' is incorrect and falls under the low-score category."
videos/session_0076_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm movements. 'Clapping' is a different hand/arm action with distinct motion patterns and intent. While both involve upper body movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0077_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Boxing,1.0,"The predicted action 'Boxing' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'boxing', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0078_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, and 'Standing' fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of 'shakehead'."
videos/session_0079_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: coughing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or speaking into it. 'Coughing' is a completely unrelated physiological action with no semantic or temporal overlap with answering a phone. There is no plausible scenario where coughing would be considered a valid part or equivalent of answering a phone."
videos/session_0080_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Putting on a mask,0.0,"The ground truth action 'eat' involves consuming food, while the predicted action 'Putting on a mask' is entirely unrelated both semantically and temporally. There is no plausible overlap or partial alignment between these actions."
videos/session_0081_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0082_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: cover face,0.3,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves actively moving a hand across the face to clean or dry it. The prediction 'cover face' implies holding the face covered, typically with hands, but without the wiping motion. While both involve hand-to-face contact, the actions are functionally and kinematically distinct—covering is static or protective, while wiping is dynamic and directional. Thus, the prediction is related but not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0083_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bend,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pickup' typically involves bending down to retrieve an object. The predicted action 'bend' accurately describes a core and necessary component of the 'pickup' motion, making it a semantically valid and temporally appropriate part of the action."
videos/session_0084_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: spreading arms,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a dynamic, full-body activity involving rhythmic jumping and arm motion coordinated with a rope. The prediction 'spreading arms' describes only a static or partial upper-body movement that does not capture the essential jumping or rhythmic nature of jump roping. While arm movement is involved in jumprope, 'spreading arms' alone is too generic and disconnected from the core action, resembling more of a static pose than the dynamic activity required."
videos/session_0085_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are distinct but highly similar cleaning actions involving repetitive arm movements and a cleaning tool on the floor. Given the low-resolution thermal video, the VLM may not distinguish between the specific tools (mop vs. broom), and both actions share strong semantic and functional overlap in the context of floor cleaning. Thus, the prediction is considered a near-equivalent match."
videos/session_0086_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: adjust headwear,0.2,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves actively grooming or brushing one's hair, while the predicted action 'adjust headwear' refers to modifying a hat or other head covering. These are distinct actions with different intents and hand movements; adjusting headwear does not constitute a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing hair."
videos/session_0087_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: wave,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'wave' involves arm movement but is a distinct social gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0088_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0089_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, object used, and motion dynamics differ significantly, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0090_type.mp4,type,Action: Sitting still,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The prediction 'Sitting still' describes a static posture with no indication of typing activity. Since 'sitting still' lacks the essential characteristic of the 'type' action and is overly generic, it is considered a completely different and incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0091_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: raise hand,0.9,"The predicted action 'raise hand' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'thumbup', as both involve lifting the hand/arm in a deliberate gesture. While not an exact match, raising the hand is a plausible and closely related action that could reasonably describe the visual content of a thermal clip labeled as 'thumbup', especially given potential ambiguity in low-resolution thermal video."
videos/session_0092_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinctly different hand movement used for greeting or signaling. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor part of the same high-level category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0093_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture (forming an 'OK' sign with thumb and index finger), while the prediction 'Waving' describes a different hand motion involving moving the hand back and forth. These are distinct actions with different intent and form, even though both involve hand movement. The prediction does not capture the specific gesture nor a temporally related phase of it."
videos/session_0094_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (forming a 'V' with fingers), while the prediction 'waving' describes a different hand motion involving movement of the hand back and forth. Although both involve hand actions, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and visual patterns, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0095_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Raise hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'Raise hand' describes a generic upward movement that does not capture the rotational or directional nature of drawing a circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0096_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The predicted action 'Pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically unrelated to drawing circles. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0097_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'Waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no indication that waving is a temporal part of presenting or holding a stop sign, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0098_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Pointing with right hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a motion where the person is pulling their hand inward toward their body, possibly in a controlled or deliberate manner. The prediction 'Pointing with right hand' describes a distinctly different gesture involving extension and directionality, not retraction or pulling. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor part of the same high-level category, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0099_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.2,"'Pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. 'Pointing' is a distinct gesture with a different intent and motion pattern—typically static or minimally dynamic, involving finger extension rather than a pushing motion. The two actions are semantically and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: wave hand,1.0,"The prediction 'wave hand' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', differing only in phrasing but describing the same action."

Although both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally different actions with no significant temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Gesturing,0.6,"Clapping is a specific form of gesturing, so 'Gesturing' is related but less precise than the ground truth 'clap'. This falls under the medium score range as it captures the general category of hand movement but lacks the specificity of the actual action."
videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: reaching with right arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, full-body movement involving gliding or moving along a surface, whereas the predicted action 'reaching with right arm' describes a localized upper-body gesture. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no clear temporal or categorical overlap. Reaching is not a plausible phase or component of sliding, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a zigzag pattern, likely on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve the repetitive, directional motion characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand use, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning left,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a rapid, evasive movement to avoid something, which typically involves lateral or sudden directional shifts. The prediction 'turning left' describes a rotational motion that may or may not be part of a dodge. While turning could occur during a dodge, it is not sufficient on its own to constitute dodging and lacks the essential evasive intent or dynamic context. Thus, the actions are only weakly related, warranting a low score."

The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically lead into drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.6,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, reflexive respiratory actions that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of upper body motion and head movement. While not the same action, they are closely related and may be difficult to distinguish under the given input constraints. However, they are distinct physiological events, so an exact or temporal-part match does not apply, placing the prediction in the medium-similarity range."

videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying on the floor,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, often on a surface such as a bed or floor. The prediction 'lying on the floor' is a semantically appropriate and common posture associated with sleeping, especially in thermal video contexts where bedding may not be distinguishable. While not an exact verbal match, it accurately reflects the physical state expected during sleep."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Raise both arms,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label encompassing a variety of expressive movements. The prediction 'Raise both arms' describes a specific motion that could plausibly occur during dancing, but it is not sufficiently indicative of dancing on its own—it could also occur in other contexts like stretching or signaling. Thus, it is related and plausible but lacks the specificity or contextual richness to be considered a strong match."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: turning around,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jog' implies continuous, rhythmic forward motion, typically involving running at a slow pace. The predicted action 'turning around' describes a brief rotational movement that is not a typical or necessary part of jogging. While turning could occur incidentally during a jog (e.g., at a corner), it does not represent the core activity and is semantically distinct from sustained locomotion. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."

The prediction 'kicking' implies a dynamic, forceful motion usually performed while standing and involving momentum. While both involve leg movement, kicking is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a deliberate legraise, and mischaracterizes the nature of the activity."
videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: raise hands,0.6,"The ground truth 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, active arm movements mimicking drumming, often with hands raised. The prediction 'raise hands' captures a key component of the action but lacks specificity about the dynamic, repetitive motion characteristic of airdrumming.

While both involve the mouth area, they are functionally unrelated actions with different motion patterns and intents, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0152_type.mp4,type,Action: looking around,0.1,"The ground truth action 'type' implies an activity involving using a keyboard or similar device, which typically involves hand/finger movements while seated. The prediction 'looking around' describes a completely different behavior that does not align with typing, nor is it a plausible temporal part or semantic equivalent.

While 'raise right arm' is part of that gesture, it is too generic and lacks the contextual specificity of signaling or stopping. Without evidence of the full stop-sign gesture or intent, this prediction is only weakly related and risks being a partial hallucination."
videos/session_0160_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: arm gesture,0.6,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a specific arm movement where the hand is pulled inward toward the body. The prediction 'arm gesture' is related and acknowledges arm motion, but it is overly generic and lacks the specificity of the intended action.

videos/session_0176_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or categorical overlap between them."
videos/session_0177_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, typically with an arm raised to the face. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container to the mouth and consuming liquid—these are entirely different actions with distinct hand-to-face trajectories and purposes. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two."
videos/session_0178_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: raise arms,0.9,"Raising arms is a common and specific movement involved in stretching oneself, making it a semantically valid and temporally plausible part of the ground truth action 'stretchoneself'."
videos/session_0179_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: talking on the phone,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or mouth but not necessarily touching the face in the same manner. These are semantically distinct actions with minimal overlap; 'talking on the phone' is not a temporal phase or valid interpretation of 'touchface'."
videos/session_0180_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."

videos/session_0182_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Shoulder tap,0.9,"The predicted action 'Shoulder tap' involves a light physical contact or push on someone's shoulder, which is a specific and plausible instance of the ground truth action 'pushsomeone'. While not an exact match, it falls within the semantic scope of intentionally making contact to push or tap another person, satisfying the intent of the label."
videos/session_0183_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'kicking' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it accurately captures the core physical action involved."
videos/session_0184_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Grab,0.2,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person. The prediction 'Grab' describes a different type of interaction—grasping or holding—which is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of punching. While both involve interpersonal contact, they are distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0185_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which often involves gestures, facial expressions, or movement while talking. While 'standing' could be a posture during conversation, it is overly generic and static, failing to capture the core interactive nature of 'conversation'. Without evidence of actual communication, the prediction is too vague and misses the semantic essence of the label."
videos/session_0186_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sit,1.0,"The predicted action 'Sit' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'sit', satisfying the criteria for a high score."
videos/session_0187_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Walking,1.0,The prediction 'Walking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'walk'.
videos/session_0188_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending forward,0.9,"The prediction 'bending forward' is a core component of the action 'bow', which typically involves leaning or bending the upper body forward as a gesture of respect or greeting. This is a semantically equivalent and temporally valid representation of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0189_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Person entering from left,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'sleep', which implies a state of rest or inactivity, typically lying down with eyes closed. The predicted action 'Person entering from left' describes a dynamic movement unrelated to sleeping. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between entering a scene and the act of sleeping, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0190_dance.mp4,dance,Action: raise both arms,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. The prediction 'raise both arms' describes a specific motion that could plausibly occur during dancing, but it is not sufficiently indicative of dancing on its own—it could also occur in other contexts like stretching or signaling. Thus, it is related and plausible but lacks the specificity or contextual richness to be considered a strong match."
videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent or temporal parts of each other. Jogging implies a faster, more vigorous pace than walking. While the actions are similar and could appear visually close in low-resolution thermal video, the prediction is less specific and does not fully capture the intensity implied by 'jog'. This falls into the medium score range due to plausible but imprecise action recognition."
videos/session_0192_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: fall,1.0,"The prediction 'fall' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', as both describe the same core event of a person losing balance and collapsing downward."
videos/session_0193_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Punching,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'punching' is an upper-body striking motion. These actions are fundamentally different in both form and intent, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0194_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping jacks,1.0,"The prediction 'jumping jacks' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'jumpingjack', differing only in formatting (space vs. no space). This constitutes a correct identification of the activity."

videos/session_0196_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Kneeling,0.3,"While both 'lunge' and 'kneeling' involve bent legs and a lowered body position, they are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent. A lunge is a dynamic exercise involving one leg forward and the other back, often in motion, while kneeling typically implies both knees on the ground in a static or resting posture. Given that 'lunge' is a specific dynamic activity and 'kneeling' does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a lunge, the prediction is only loosely related but largely incorrect."
videos/session_0197_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The prediction 'turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', representing the same activity with only minor grammatical variation."
videos/session_0198_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bend,0.6,"The predicted action 'bend' is related to 'pushup' as bending the body is a component of performing a pushup, but it is less specific and could describe many other actions (e.g., bending forward while standing). It captures part of the motion but lacks the full context of a pushup, which involves a prone position and upper-body support."
videos/session_0199_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching' describes an upright, rhythmic walking-like movement, which is biomechanically and contextually distinct from a leg raise. While both involve leg movement, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor does 'marching' fall under a plausible interpretation of 'legraise'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0200_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of motions (e.g., bringing a container to the mouth) and is unrelated both semantically and kinematically. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0201_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, aggressive arm movements such as punching, while the predicted action 'pointing' is a static or minimally dynamic gesture with a different intent and motion pattern. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0202_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Head turning,0.9,"The predicted action 'Head turning' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead'. Both involve deliberate lateral or rotational movement of the head, and in low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing subtle head motion nuances is challenging. The prediction captures the core intent of the action."
videos/session_0203_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Covering Mouth,0.2,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' implies interacting with a phone, typically involving holding it to the ear or speaking into it. 'Covering mouth' is not a typical or necessary part of answering a phone and does not semantically align with the core activity. It may occur incidentally (e.g., coughing while on a call), but it is not representative of the labeled action, making this prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0204_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drinking,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, making the prediction a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0205_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0206_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: covering face,0.3,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves actively moving a hand across the face to clean or dry it. The prediction 'covering face' implies a static or protective gesture (e.g., hiding or shielding the face), which is semantically distinct and does not capture the wiping motion. While both involve the face and hands, the core action differs significantly."
videos/session_0207_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: pick up object,1.0,"The prediction 'pick up object' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth action 'pickup', describing the same high-level activity with slightly more detail."
videos/session_0208_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves a dynamic, rhythmic jumping motion with arm movement to swing a rope. The predicted action 'waving' primarily involves arm movement without the characteristic jumping or full-body coordination of jump roping. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping the floor are distinct but highly similar cleaning actions that involve comparable body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). Given the low-resolution thermal video input, the VLM may not distinguish between a mop and a broom, and both actions fall under the same functional category of floor cleaning. Thus, the prediction is semantically close enough to warrant a high score."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: put hands on head,0.6,"The predicted action 'put hands on head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand movement near the head, but it lacks specificity and does not clearly indicate hair brushing. It falls into a plausible but ambiguous interaction, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0211_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Pointing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow to lift a weight. The predicted action 'Pointing' involves extending the arm and finger in a static or gestural manner, which is anatomically and functionally distinct from a bicep curl. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0212_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically holding it and looking at the screen. The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking constitutes a part of or a valid interpretation of playing with a phone."
videos/session_0213_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0214_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially since 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0215_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in phrasing (pluralization and spacing), which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0216_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Raising right arm,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Raising right arm' describes a gross upper-body movement that does not involve the fine motor configuration of the hand required for a thumbs-down gesture. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0217_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to a specific hand gesture (forming the 'OK' sign with thumb and index finger), while the predicted action 'waving' describes a different, unrelated hand motion. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intent and form, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0218_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: making a peace sign,1.0,"The predicted action 'making a peace sign' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly used interchangeably in everyday contexts."
videos/session_0219_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: right arm raise,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a circular motion of the arm (likely hand or forearm) in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'right arm raise' describes a vertical lifting motion, which is fundamentally different in trajectory and intent. While both involve arm movement, raising the arm does not constitute or closely approximate drawing a clockwise circle, nor is it a logical temporal segment of that action."
videos/session_0220_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Arm raise,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion in a counterclockwise direction, likely involving controlled hand or arm movement tracing a circle. The prediction 'Arm raise' describes a fundamentally different motion—lifting the arm vertically—without any indication of circular or directional movement. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0221_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture altogether and does not correspond to the expected action or any logical temporal part of it. There is no semantic overlap between 'stopsign' and 'waving'."
videos/session_0222_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Making a phone call (holding phone to ear),0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific movement involving pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The predicted action 'Making a phone call (holding phone to ear)' describes a completely different and unrelated gesture. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, and the prediction does not represent a plausible part or interpretation of 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0223_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension to indicate direction or object, with no inherent pushing or repelling component. The two actions differ significantly in intent, motion, and physical interaction, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0224_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: arm raise,0.9,"The predicted action 'arm raise' is a close semantic and physical approximation of 'handwave', as both involve deliberate upward or visible arm movement. While not an exact match, waving typically includes raising or moving the arm in a noticeable way, making this prediction highly consistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0225_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0226_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The prediction 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'clap'.
videos/session_0227_slide.mp4,slide,Action: crossing arms,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'crossing arms' is a static upper-body gesture with no relation to sliding. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0228_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0229_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden shifts in body position. 'Walking' is a slow, steady, and non-evasive gait that does not align with the intent or dynamics of dodging. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0230_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: squat,0.3,"While squatting can be a component of the bowling motion (e.g., during the approach or follow-through), it is not sufficiently representative of the full 'bowling' action on its own. Bowling involves a coordinated sequence including arm swing, ball release, and often a step or slide—squatting alone is too generic and could correspond to many unrelated activities. Thus, the prediction is only weakly related and does not capture the essence of the labeled action."
videos/session_0231_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: wave,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' involves raising a hand, which is semantically very close to 'wave', as waving typically includes lifting the hand. While not an exact match, it is a plausible and specific interpretation of the same general motion in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0232_tap.mp4,tap,Action: adjusting clothing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, deliberate contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the prediction 'adjusting clothing' describes a different, more prolonged self-grooming behavior. These actions are semantically distinct with little overlap in intent or motion pattern, and 'adjusting clothing' is not a plausible temporal phase or variant of 'tap'."
videos/session_0233_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Raise arm (right),0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Raise arm (right)' describes a gross upper-body movement that does not involve the specific hand motion implied by the label. While both involve arm/hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution. The prediction misses the core hand-based nature of the ground truth and is therefore largely incorrect."
videos/session_0234_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: raise right arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate motion likely involving arm movement to trace a triangular shape. The prediction 'raise right arm' is a generic, partial gesture that does not capture the structured, multi-directional motion required to draw a triangle. While raising an arm could be a component of the action, it lacks the specificity and sequence needed to reasonably represent 'drawtriangle', making it largely inconsistent with the intended activity."
videos/session_0235_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'drinking' involves a deliberate, manual interaction with a container.

There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between coughing and drinking, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0237_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Bending forward,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty in coordination. The prediction 'bending forward' describes a static or postural change that does not capture the dynamic, unstable locomotion inherent to staggering. While both involve body motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and movement patterns."
videos/session_0238_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving ingestion of liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them related."
videos/session_0239_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: covering face with both hands,0.3,"The ground truth action 'blownose' typically involves using a tissue or hand to clear the nose, often with one hand near the nose and possibly head tilted down. The prediction 'covering face with both hands' is a different gesture that may relate to shielding the face, embarrassment, or cold—but not specifically blowing one's nose. While there is slight overlap (hands near face), the actions are functionally distinct, and the prediction lacks the specificity or semantic equivalence required for a higher score."
videos/session_0240_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a common and specific movement that falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself'. It aligns well with the intent of the ground truth label, which involves self-directed stretching actions, and is not overly generic or unrelated."
videos/session_0241_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Covering mouth,0.9,"Covering the mouth is a specific instance of touching the face, which aligns closely with the ground truth action 'touchface'. While not an exact lexical match, it is a semantically valid and plausible manifestation of the labeled behavior."

videos/session_0243_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Grabbing,0.3,"While 'grabbing' involves physical contact, it lacks the mutual, affectionate, and bilateral nature of a 'hug'. The actions are related in that they both involve arms and proximity, but 'grabbing' typically implies a unilateral or utilitarian action rather than an embrace. Therefore, it is not a semantic equivalent nor a typical temporal phase of hugging."
videos/session_0244_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Shoulder tap,0.6,"The ground truth 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful or intentional physical interaction where one person pushes another. The prediction 'Shoulder tap' describes a light, non-forceful touch, typically used to get someone's attention. While both involve physical contact between individuals, the intent and intensity differ significantly. However, they are related in that they describe interpersonal physical interactions, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0245_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kick,1.0,"The prediction 'Kick' is a direct and semantically equivalent match to the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it captures the core action of kicking, which is the defining component of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0246_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: gesturing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies a specific, aggressive physical interaction involving a striking motion. The prediction 'gesturing' is a vague and significantly less intense action that does not convey the forceful or combative nature of punching. While both involve arm movement, gesturing is too generic and semantically distant from the intent and mechanics of punching, falling into the low-score category."

videos/session_0250_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bend forward,0.9,"The prediction 'bend forward' is a semantically equivalent and core component of the ground truth action 'bow', which typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The VLM's description captures the essential motion accurately."
videos/session_0251_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying on the ground,0.9,"The prediction 'lying on the ground' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action of sleeping in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0252_dance.mp4,dance,Action: raise arms,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Raise arms' is a plausible component of dancing and reflects an active motion consistent with dance, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the rhythmic or expressive nature typically associated with dancing. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but underspecified prediction."
videos/session_0253_jog.mp4,jog,Action: running,1.0,"The prediction 'running' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'jog', as both describe similar forms of fast, repetitive locomotion. In the context of human activity recognition, especially from low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing between jogging and running is often impractical, and they are commonly treated as interchangeable."
videos/session_0254_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: kneel down and stand up,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies an uncontrolled or accidental collapse to the ground, whereas the prediction 'kneel down and stand up' describes a controlled, intentional sequence of movements. These are semantically distinct: falling down is not a temporal part of kneeling and standing, nor vice versa. The actions differ in intent, dynamics, and physical execution, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0255_jump.mp4,jump,Action: jumping,1.0,The prediction 'jumping' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'jump'.
videos/session_0256_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a core component of a jumping jack, which involves simultaneously raising the arms overhead while jumping. Although the prediction omits the leg movement and jumping aspect, it accurately captures a defining upper-body motion of the activity, making it a strong partial match consistent with the temporal and semantic nature of the ground truth."
videos/session_0257_squat.mp4,squat,Action: punch,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' involves bending the knees and lowering the body, typically as part of exercise or movement. The predicted action 'punch' is a completely different upper-body motion with no semantic or temporal overlap with squatting. There is no plausible scenario where punching is a part of or equivalent to squatting, resulting in a very low score."

The prediction 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing teeth. While both involve the mouth area, the actions are functionally and contextually distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0276_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which is a specific, fine-grained activity typically involving hand movements while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes only a static posture and does not capture the essential typing behavior. While sitting may be part of the context, it is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'type', nor is it a specific instance of an abstract label. Therefore, the prediction fails to match the intended action."

videos/session_0285_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, outward pushing motion with the hand, likely involving force or resistance. The prediction 'pointing' is a distinctly different gesture that involves extending a finger to indicate direction or object, lacking the pushing or repelling motion central to 'pushhandaway'. The two actions are not temporally related nor semantically equivalent, and pointing does not represent a plausible phase or variant of pushing a hand away."

videos/session_0305_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Grappling,0.6,"While 'grappling' is not an exact match for 'hug', both involve close physical contact between individuals. Grappling is more aggressive or sport-oriented, whereas hugging is affectionate, but the actions share spatial and postural similarities in thermal video where fine emotional cues are absent. This constitutes a related but less specific interpretation, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0306_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Punching,0.6,"While 'punching' and 'pushsomeone' are both aggressive or forceful interpersonal actions, they are distinct in intent and motion: punching involves a striking motion with a closed fist, whereas pushing typically uses open hands to exert force. However, in low-resolution thermal video, these actions may appear visually similar, and both involve direct physical contact. Thus, the prediction is related but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0307_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: posture adjustment,0.1,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a dynamic, aggressive motion involving leg movement directed at another person. The prediction 'posture adjustment' describes a minor, non-aggressive, and typically static or subtle body repositioning, which is semantically and behaviorally inconsistent with kicking. There is no plausible temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0308_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: touching another person,0.3,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies a forceful, aggressive motion directed at another person. The prediction 'touching another person' describes a much gentler and non-aggressive interaction that lacks the intent and dynamics of punching.

videos/session_0312_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'Bending' accurately captures the core physical motion involved in bowing, even if it lacks the specific contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity rather than intent, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid match."
videos/session_0313_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying on the floor,0.9,"The prediction 'lying on the floor' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact lexical match, it accurately reflects the core physical state associated with the action of sleeping."

videos/session_0315_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that share visual similarities, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details (like gait speed) may be ambiguous. However, jogging implies a faster, more dynamic movement than walking, so the prediction is plausible but not fully accurate. This falls under a related but less specific interpretation, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0316_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Diving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to an unintentional loss of balance and collapse to the ground, typically associated with accidents or health incidents. In contrast, 'diving' is a controlled, intentional movement often performed into water or as part of a sport. While both involve downward motion, their intent, context, and physical dynamics are fundamentally different. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0317_jump.mp4,jump,Action: stretching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, high-energy movement, while the predicted action 'stretching' is a slow, static, or low-intensity activity.

videos/session_0323_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'legraise' is a dynamic, specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The prediction 'standing' describes a static posture that does not correspond to any plausible temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a leg raise. Given the dynamic nature of 'legraise', a generic static label like 'standing' is incorrect and falls into the low-score category."

The prediction 'raise arms sideways' describes only a static or partial upper-body movement that does not capture the essential jumping or coordinated motion of jump roping. While arm raising may occur as part of jumprope, it is insufficient on its own and could correspond to many unrelated actions (e.g., stretching, signaling). Thus, the prediction is too generic and misses the core dynamic nature of the labeled activity."

The prediction 'raise right hand' describes a general arm movement that does not capture the distinctive hand shape or intent of making the 'OK' sign. While raising the hand might be part of the motion to initiate the gesture, it is not sufficient to constitute the action itself, making the prediction only loosely related and significantly less specific."

The predicted action 'Arm raise' describes a generic upward movement of the arm, which does not semantically align with the conventional 'stop' gesture (typically a forward-facing, extended arm with an open palm). Given the context of HAR datasets, 'stopsign' is a well-defined class distinct from arbitrary arm movements, so this is a mismatch."

videos/session_0350_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bend over,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bend over' is a close semantic and physical approximation of the ground truth 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist. While not an exact lexical match, the actions are functionally and visually similar in the context of thermal video where fine details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0351_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a valid and highly indicative posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. Thus, it qualifies as a semantically equivalent and temporally appropriate representation of the action."
videos/session_0352_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jump,0.6,"While 'jump' is not an exact match for 'dance', jumping can be a component of certain dance styles, making it a plausible and related action. However, it is less specific and does not fully capture the expressive or rhythmic nature typically associated with dancing, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jumping,0.3,"While both 'jog' and 'jumping' are dynamic activities, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns.

videos/session_0355_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Squat,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both feet leaving the ground, while the predicted action 'squat' is a distinct lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips while keeping the feet on the ground. These are fundamentally different actions with little semantic or temporal overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0356_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a key and characteristic component of a jumping jack. While the prediction doesn't capture the full motion (which also includes leg movement), it accurately describes a defining upper-body action within the 'jumpingjack' sequence, making it a strong partial match consistent with temporal partiality guidelines."

videos/session_0370_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: spreading arms,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a dynamic, full-body activity involving rhythmic jumping and arm motion coordinated with a rope. The prediction 'spreading arms' describes only a static or partial upper-body movement that does not capture the essential nature of jump roping. While arm movement is involved in jumprope, 'spreading arms' alone is too generic and disconnected from the core action, resembling more of a pose than the actual activity."
videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). While not identical, they are close enough in context and intent to warrant a high score, especially given the low-resolution thermal video input which may obscure fine-grained distinctions."
videos/session_0372_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: adjusting headwear,0.2,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves actively grooming or brushing one's hair, while the predicted action 'adjusting headwear' refers to manipulating a hat or similar item. These are distinct actions with different intents and hand movements; adjusting headwear does not constitute a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing hair."
videos/session_0373_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is a distinct social gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0374_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically while holding it and looking at the screen. The predicted action 'drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap.

videos/session_0375_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, motion dynamics, and purpose are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch."
videos/session_0376_type.mp4,type,Action: Reading,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'Reading' is a completely different activity that does not involve typing and is not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or valid instance of 'type'. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect."

The predicted action 'raise right arm' describes a linear upward movement, which is fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent. While both involve arm movement, raising an arm is not a temporal part nor a semantic equivalent of drawing a clockwise circle, resulting in a very low match."
videos/session_0382_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically side-to-side or up-and-down repetitive hand motion that does not match the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a counterclockwise circle. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0383_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'Waving' describes a dynamic hand gesture that is semantically unrelated to presenting or holding a stop sign. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between waving and displaying a stop sign, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0384_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'Waving' describes a distinctly different outward, repetitive hand motion typically used for greeting. These actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is waving a plausible temporal phase or variant of pulling a hand in. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0385_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion dynamics differ significantly, making this a mismatch rather than a temporal or semantic variant."
videos/session_0386_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Salute,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'salute' involve arm movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. A salute is a specific, formal gesture typically involving a rigid hand position near the forehead, whereas handwaving is a broader, often side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'salute' is not a valid temporal part nor a semantic equivalent, but it is loosely related due to shared upper-body involvement—hence a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0387_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: presenting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' refers to a specific cleaning motion involving repetitive arm movements with a broom or similar tool. The predicted action 'presenting' implies a communicative or demonstrative gesture, such as showing or explaining something, which is semantically and physically unrelated to sweeping.

videos/session_0389_slide.mp4,slide,Action: presenting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'presenting' suggests a static or communicative activity (e.g., giving a talk or showing something). These actions are semantically unrelated and do not share temporal, functional, or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0390_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movements in a controlled, repetitive angular motion. The prediction 'waving' describes a broad, rhythmic arm motion typically used for greeting or signaling, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, the intent, trajectory, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0391_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: walk,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden directional changes. The predicted action 'walk' describes a slow, steady, and linear motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from dodging.

The predicted action 'wave' is a gross motor movement involving moving the whole hand or arm back and forth, which is semantically and kinematically distinct. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0396_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically lead into drawing a triangle.

videos/session_0405_hug.mp4,hug,Action: kissing,0.3,"While both 'hug' and 'kissing' involve close interpersonal interaction, they are distinct actions with different physical characteristics. A hug typically involves embracing with arms, whereas kissing involves contact with lips. The VLM's prediction does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of hugging, nor is it a plausible sub-action within the context of the ground truth label. Therefore, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated, warranting a low score."

The predicted action 'raise right arm' describes a linear upward movement, which is fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent. While both involve arm movement, raising an arm does not constitute or closely approximate drawing a clockwise circle, nor is it a logical temporal segment of that action."
videos/session_0443_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down gesture that does not match the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a counterclockwise circle.

videos/session_0453_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: kneeling,0.3,"While both 'lunge' and 'kneeling' involve bent legs and a lowered body position, they are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent. A lunge is a dynamic exercise involving one leg forward and the other back, often in motion, whereas kneeling typically implies both knees on the ground in a static or resting posture. Given that 'lunge' is a specific exercise and 'kneeling' does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a lunge, the prediction is only loosely related but largely incorrect."

videos/session_0464_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: dancing,0.3,"Jumping rope is a specific, rhythmic, and repetitive physical activity primarily involving vertical jumps while swinging a rope. Dancing, while also dynamic, involves different movement patterns (e.g., expressive, varied steps, arm movements) and is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of jumprope. Although both are active, they are distinct actions with little overlap in form or intent, making the prediction incorrect for this specific ground truth."

videos/session_0524_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: turning around,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' implies deliberate extension or flexing of the body to stretch muscles, which is a specific type of movement. The predicted action 'turning around' involves rotation of the body but does not inherently involve stretching. While both are dynamic actions, they are semantically distinct and serve different purposes; turning around is not a temporal part nor a valid instance of stretching oneself."
videos/session_0525_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Touching face,1.0,"The prediction 'Touching face' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'touchface', differing only in phrasing and capitalization."

videos/session_0531_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Pat on shoulder,0.2,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion directed at another person, while the prediction 'Pat on shoulder' describes a gentle, non-aggressive social gesture. Although both involve arm movement toward another person, the intent, force, and semantic meaning are fundamentally different. This constitutes a significant mismatch in action semantics."
videos/session_0532_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: shoulder touch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies social interaction, typically involving talking and listening, often while stationary or with minimal movement. The predicted action 'shoulder touch' describes a specific physical gesture that is not inherently part of a conversation and lacks evidence of verbal or interactive context. While a shoulder touch could occur during a conversation, it is not representative of the core activity and is more aligned with physical contact or exercise-like movements, making it largely inconsistent with the ground truth."

videos/session_0536_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Pushing chair,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sleep' implies a state of rest or inactivity, typically involving lying down with eyes closed. The predicted action 'Pushing chair' is an active, dynamic movement that is semantically and physically inconsistent with sleeping. There is no plausible temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0537_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jumping jack,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of rhythmic or expressive movements. 'Jumping jack' is a specific, energetic physical activity that could reasonably occur within a freestyle dance context, especially given the instruction for 'freestyle' to mean any self-chosen action. Thus, the prediction is a valid instance of the broader 'dance' category."
videos/session_0538_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0539_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: falling,1.0,"The prediction 'falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same event with slightly different phrasing."

videos/session_0541_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a key and characteristic component of a jumping jack. While the prediction doesn't capture the full motion (which also includes leg movement), it accurately describes a defining upper-body action within the 'jumpingjack' sequence, making it a semantically valid partial match."
videos/session_0542_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squatting,1.0,"The prediction 'Squatting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'squat', representing the same physical activity."
videos/session_0543_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: running,0.1,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, whereas the predicted action 'running' is a distinct dynamic activity involving continuous strides. Although both are forms of physical movement, they are biomechanically and semantically different actions with little overlap in motion pattern or intent. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0544_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The prediction 'turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', representing the same core activity."
videos/session_0545_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Crawling,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise performed in a prone position, while the predicted action 'crawling' involves forward motion on hands and knees or belly. Although both involve being low to the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. There is no significant semantic overlap or temporal relationship that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0546_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Marching in place,0.2,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting one or both legs while lying down or in a controlled position, typically targeting core muscles. The predicted action 'Marching in place' involves alternating leg lifts while standing and is a different type of movement with distinct biomechanics and intent. Although both involve leg motion, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor is marching a valid instantiation of 'legraise'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0547_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'Throwing' describes a distinctly different motion involving propelling an object, which is not semantically related, nor a temporal part, nor a plausible interpretation of airdrumming. The actions are fundamentally dissimilar in intent and motion pattern."
videos/session_0548_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The prediction 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'boxing', as punching or throwing punches is fundamental to boxing. While not an exact label match, it accurately captures a defining movement of the activity."
videos/session_0549_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: head turning,0.9,"The predicted action 'head turning' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead'. Both involve deliberate lateral or rotational movement of the head, and in the context of thermal video with limited resolution, such fine-grained distinctions may not be reliably discernible. The actions are functionally equivalent for HAR purposes."
videos/session_0550_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0551_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal part or semantic equivalent, making the prediction a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0552_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0553_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is distinctly different from 'drinking', an action typically involving holding a container and consuming liquid. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between these two actions, and 'drinking' does not represent a plausible part or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0554_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Picking up an object,1.0,"The prediction 'Picking up an object' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth action 'pickup', describing the same high-level activity with appropriate specificity."
videos/session_0555_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' refers to a specific, rhythmic jumping activity typically involving a rope. The prediction 'dancing' describes a different category of movement that, while dynamic, is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of jump roping. Although both are active and may share some visual motion patterns in low-resolution thermal video, they represent distinct activities with different intent and form. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0556_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Swinging an object,0.6,"Mopping the floor typically involves swinging or moving a mop in a controlled, repetitive motion, so 'swinging an object' is a plausible but less specific description of the action. While it captures the dynamic motion involved, it lacks the contextual specificity of 'moppingfloor', placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0557_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.6,"The predicted action 'touching head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks specificity. Brushing hair implies a repeated, grooming motion, whereas 'touching head' could refer to a brief or incidental contact. This is a plausible but ambiguous interpretation, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0558_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: adjusting a bag,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'adjusting a bag' describes a completely different, non-exercise-related activity that does not correspond to any plausible temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a bicep curl. There is no meaningful overlap in action semantics or intent."
videos/session_0559_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Clapping,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically while holding it and looking at the screen. 'Clapping' is a completely different action with no semantic or temporal overlap—it does not represent a phase of using a phone nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract or partial visibility constraints."
videos/session_0560_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The prediction 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) that is semantically and behaviorally distinct. While both involve the mouth area, they are functionally unrelated actions with different intent and motion patterns, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0561_type.mp4,type,Action: using a mobile phone,0.2,"The ground truth action 'type' implies interaction with a keyboard or device for text input, while the prediction 'using a mobile phone' suggests a different modality of device interaction (e.g., swiping, tapping apps) that is not necessarily typing. Although both involve handheld devices, 'using a mobile phone' is too generic and does not specifically capture the act of typing, making it a weak match at best."
videos/session_0562_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'Thumbs up' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in capitalization and phrasing."
videos/session_0563_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Waving' describes a different hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These are distinct gestures with different meanings and motion patterns, making them semantically unrelated in this context."
videos/session_0564_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: two-finger hand gesture,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers specifically to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (typically a circle with thumb and index finger). The prediction 'two-finger hand gesture' describes a different gesture (likely involving two extended fingers, such as a peace or victory sign), which is not semantically equivalent or a temporal part of making the 'OK' sign. While both involve hand gestures, they are distinct actions with different configurations, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0565_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a victory (V) sign with the hand,1.0,The predicted action 'Making a victory (V) sign with the hand' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'makevictorysign'.
videos/session_0566_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down gesture that does not resemble drawing a circle. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in motion pattern or intent."
videos/session_0567_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: taking a photograph,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'taking a photograph' involves a completely different set of movements (e.g., holding a camera, pressing a button) and shares no semantic or temporal overlap with drawing a circle. The actions are unrelated both in intent and motion pattern."
videos/session_0568_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: raise hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is mimicking or interacting with a stop sign, which typically involves raising a hand in a specific gesture (e.g., palm outstretched). While 'raise hand' is somewhat related, it is too generic and lacks the contextual specificity of signaling 'stop'. Without clear indication of the stop gesture, this prediction is only loosely associated and risks being a generic motion rather than the intended symbolic action."
videos/session_0569_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'Waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a greeting or signaling motion, which is directionally and functionally different. While both involve hand movement, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor is waving a plausible interpretation of 'pullhandin'. Thus, the match is weak but not entirely unrelated (e.g., both are arm/hand actions), warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0570_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion pattern are fundamentally different, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0571_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth."

There is no semantic overlap, temporal connection, or contextual plausibility between the two actions."
videos/session_0575_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movement in a controlled, repetitive angular motion. The prediction 'waving' describes a broad, rhythmic arm motion typically used for greeting or signaling, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, the intent, trajectory, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0576_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden directional changes. 'Walking' is a slow, steady, and non-evasive gait that does not capture the dynamic or reactive nature of dodging. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0577_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: throwing,0.9,"The predicted action 'throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves the act of throwing a ball. While not an exact label match, it accurately captures the essential motion in the context of the activity."
videos/session_0578_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Pointing,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'pointing', as pointing typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this is a reasonable and specific interpretation of the action."

videos/session_0580_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or specific hand signals. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0581_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, pointing is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of drawing a triangle, nor is it a plausible component of that specific action. Thus, the prediction is only loosely related at best, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0583_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Head raise,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action typically involving the torso and head but primarily characterized by a forceful exhalation. The predicted action 'Head raise' describes a voluntary neck movement that is not a typical or necessary component of coughing. While a cough might coincidentally involve slight head motion, 'head raise' is not semantically equivalent, a temporal phase, or a plausible manifestation of coughing. Therefore, the prediction is largely unrelated to the ground truth."
videos/session_0584_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: turning,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often with loss of balance. The prediction 'turning' describes a controlled rotational motion, which is not semantically equivalent nor a typical temporal component of staggering.

videos/session_0586_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are distinct behaviors with different hand-to-face interactions and motion patterns. Coughing does not constitute a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of blowing one's nose, nor is it a valid instance under an abstract label. Thus, the prediction is related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0587_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Spreading arms,0.9,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' typically involves extending limbs or the body, and 'spreading arms' is a specific, plausible instance of self-stretching. This aligns well semantically and temporally with the intended activity."
videos/session_0588_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth. Although both may involve hand-to-head motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution. Drinking is not a temporal phase or valid variant of touching one's face, nor are they interchangeable in this context."

videos/session_0669_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."
videos/session_0670_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: raise right hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, coordinated motion typically using a broom or similar tool, engaging the arms and torso in a lateral or forward-backward motion. The prediction 'raise right hand' describes a brief, isolated arm movement that does not capture the essence, pattern, or purpose of sweeping. While both involve arm motion, raising a hand is neither a temporal phase nor a semantic equivalent of sweeping, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0671_clap.mp4,clap,Action: hand raise,0.3,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves rhythmic hand contact, while the prediction 'hand raise' describes a different upper-body gesture that does not entail clapping. Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. 'Hand raise' is not a temporal phase or equivalent of clapping, nor is it a plausible variant under abstract labeling."
videos/session_0672_slide.mp4,slide,Action: touching face,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, full-body movement involving motion along a surface, while the predicted action 'touching face' is a small, static upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding.

The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0674_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in direction or body orientation. The prediction 'turning' is related, as turning can be part of a dodging motion, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the evasive or reactive nature of 'dodge'. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap."
videos/session_0675_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The predicted action 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves the act of throwing a ball.

These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0678_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a nearly complete mismatch."
videos/session_0679_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: raise right arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific upper-body motion, likely involving coordinated arm movements to trace a triangular shape. The prediction 'raise right arm' describes only a single, generic arm movement that does not capture the distinctive pattern or intent of drawing a triangle. While raising an arm could be a component of the action, it is too partial and unspecific to be considered a correct or semantically equivalent interpretation."

While both involve locomotion, 'walking' does not capture the distinctive instability inherent to 'staggering,' making this a semantically different action rather than a temporal part or valid variant."
videos/session_0683_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: face touch,0.2,"Yawning and face touching are distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. While both involve the head/face region, face touch does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of yawning. The prediction is unrelated to the ground truth action."
videos/session_0684_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in thermal video due to head/face motion, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and mechanics. Blowing one's nose typically involves holding a tissue and deliberate nasal exhalation, whereas coughing is a reflexive throat/chest action. The VLM's prediction is related but not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or valid instance of the ground truth action."

videos/session_0689_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Shoulder tap,0.6,"The ground truth 'pushsomeone' implies a deliberate act of applying force to another person. 'Shoulder tap' suggests a light, possibly non-forceful contact, which may be a milder or incomplete form of interaction. While both involve physical contact with another person, the intent and intensity differ. However, in a low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing a forceful push from a tap may be ambiguous, making the prediction plausibly related but not fully aligned."

videos/session_0691_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, directed physical motion toward another person, while the prediction 'waving' is a benign, non-contact gesture. Although both involve arm movement, their intent, dynamics, and semantic meaning are fundamentally different. This constitutes a completely different action with minimal functional or contextual overlap."

videos/session_0694_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: shooting a gun,0.2,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing any self-chosen activity, typically involving dynamic movement. The prediction 'shooting a gun' is a very specific and unrelated action that does not align with the general intent of 'freestyle' as defined (i.e., arbitrary physical activity). Unless the video clearly depicts gun-related motion—which is unlikely in a generic HAR context—this prediction is a significant mismatch and likely a hallucination."

videos/session_0699_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Running,0.0,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies rhythmic, expressive body movements, typically involving the whole body in a coordinated manner. The predicted action 'Running' is a completely different physical activity focused on locomotion and lacks the characteristic features of dancing. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between running and dancing in this context."
videos/session_0700_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0701_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Push-up exercise,0.0,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'Push-up exercise' describes a controlled, intentional physical activity performed while prone, which is semantically and physically unrelated to falling. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0702_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Throwing an object,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'Throwing an object' involves a distinct upper-body motion with a different intent and biomechanics. These actions are semantically and kinematically unrelated, constituting a clear mismatch."

videos/session_0704_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: No human activity detected,0.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing some form of voluntary activity, which could be any movement. The prediction 'No human activity detected' contradicts this by asserting inactivity, which is incorrect unless the video truly shows no person or motion. Given the context, this is a complete mismatch and falls under hallucination or failure to detect activity."
videos/session_0705_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: raise both arms,0.9,"Raising both arms is a key and characteristic component of a jumping jack. While the prediction doesn't capture the full motion (which also includes leg movement), it accurately describes a defining upper-body action of the 'jumpingjack' ground truth, making it a strong partial match consistent with temporal or component-based correctness."

Both fall under the same high-level activity category of floor cleaning, making the prediction highly plausible and contextually appropriate."
videos/session_0721_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Salute,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves a person using a hand to brush or comb their hair, typically with repetitive arm movements near the head. The predicted action 'Salute' is a distinct gesture involving raising the hand to the forehead in a formal or military manner. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and body part usage. There is no temporal or semantic overlap that would justify considering 'salute' as a valid part or equivalent of 'brushhair'."
videos/session_0722_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Putting on a hat,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'Putting on a hat' involves a completely different motion (reaching overhead to place an object on the head) and shares no semantic, functional, or temporal relationship with a bicep curl.

'Shoulder tap' describes a light, often non-forceful contact, typically used to get someone's attention. While both involve physical interaction with another person and contact near the upper body, a shoulder tap is generally not equivalent to pushing. However, in low-resolution thermal video, subtle distinctions in force or intent may be ambiguous, making this a related but less specific or slightly mismatched interpretation rather than a complete error."
videos/session_0763_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Punch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' involves a leg-based aggressive motion, while the prediction 'Punch' refers to an arm-based aggressive action. Although both are forms of physical assault, they involve different body parts and movement patterns, making them distinct actions in the context of HAR. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0764_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: slap,0.9,"Both 'punchsomeone' and 'slap' involve striking another person with the hand or fist. While not identical, they are semantically similar aggressive actions directed at someone, and in the context of low-resolution thermal video, such fine-grained distinction may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is considered a close semantic match."

The predicted action 'Pointing' is a static or minimally dynamic gesture that is semantically unrelated to boxing. It does not represent a temporal phase of boxing, nor is it a plausible component or abstraction of the activity. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0775_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Turning (body rotation),0.2,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' refers specifically to a lateral or vertical movement of the head, typically while the body remains relatively still. The prediction 'Turning (body rotation)' describes a full-body or torso rotation, which is a different motion involving different body parts and mechanics. Although both involve rotational movement, they are not semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of the same action. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

The predicted action 'Waving' describes a different hand motion entirely—typically an open-hand movement used for greeting or signaling. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, with no significant overlap in motion or intent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0791_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: raise right hand,0.9,"Making a victory sign typically involves raising one hand (often the right) with the index and middle fingers extended. The predicted action 'raise right hand' is a core component of performing the 'makevictorysign' gesture, even if it doesn't specify the exact finger configuration. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, this level of detail may not be discernible, so the prediction is semantically aligned with the ground truth."

The prediction 'Pointing with the right hand' describes a static or directional gesture that does not capture the circular, dynamic nature of the true action. While both involve hand movement, pointing is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of drawing a circle, making the prediction largely incorrect."
videos/session_0793_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: raise right arm,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a circular, controlled arm movement, likely with the hand or arm tracing a counter-clockwise path. The prediction 'raise right arm' describes a simple vertical lifting motion, which is neither semantically equivalent nor a plausible temporal segment of drawing a circle. The actions are fundamentally different in motion pattern and intent."
videos/session_0794_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'Waving' describes a dynamic hand gesture that is semantically unrelated to presenting or holding a stop sign. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between waving and displaying a stop sign, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0795_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward, possibly toward the body or chest. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. These actions are semantically unrelated and involve distinct motion patterns and intent. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering 'drinking' as a valid interpretation or part of 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0796_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion profile differ significantly, making this a related but incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0797_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: face adjustment,0.1,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a clear, dynamic arm movement to signal or greet, while the predicted action 'face adjustment' refers to touching or adjusting the face, which is a different and unrelated gesture. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0798_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: reaching,0.3,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'reaching' describes a single, directional arm extension. Although reaching might occur as a minor component during sweeping (e.g., extending to grab a broom), it does not capture the core or characteristic motion of sweeping. The prediction is too generic and misses the essential dynamic pattern of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0799_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Coughing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves deliberate hand movements to produce sound, while the predicted action 'coughing' is a respiratory reflex with no relation to clapping.

There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0806_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or specific hand signals. The predicted action 'waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0807_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically lead to drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and trajectory, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0808_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: coughing,0.8,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, reflexive respiratory actions that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of upper body motion and head movement.

videos/session_0812_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, typically with arm movement near the face. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a completely different activity with distinct motion patterns and object interactions. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0813_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: put hands on hips,0.6,"Putting hands on hips can be a posture adopted during stretching, but it is not inherently a stretching motion itself. While the actions are related and may co-occur, 'put hands on hips' is less specific and does not clearly convey the dynamic or intentional movement implied by 'stretchoneself'. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a plausible but insufficiently descriptive match."
videos/session_0814_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'drinking' typically involves holding a container and bringing it to the mouth.

videos/session_0819_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: touch shoulder,0.2,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, forceful motion directed at another person. The prediction 'touch shoulder' describes a gentle, non-aggressive contact that lacks the intent, force, or dynamics of punching. While both involve physical contact, they are semantically and behaviorally distinct, falling into different categories of human interaction."
videos/session_0820_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies social interaction, typically involving people standing or sitting still while talking. 'Walking' is a locomotive activity that generally does not align with the core nature of conversation, unless contextual cues suggest walking while talking—but such nuance isn't indicated here. Given the mismatch in activity type (interactive vs. locomotive), the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0821_gym.mp4,gym,Action: retrieving an object from pocket,0.2,"The ground truth 'gym' implies dynamic physical activity or exercise, while the prediction 'retrieving an object from pocket' describes a minor, non-exercise-related gesture.

The prediction 'adjusting headwear' describes a brief, incidental, and mostly static gesture that does not constitute a meaningful or representative action under the 'freestyle' category. It lacks the expected level of activity or intent implied by the abstract label."
videos/session_0831_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Dancing,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various physical activities. Dancing is a form of physical exercise and falls within the plausible range of actions for a 'gym' context, especially given that 'freestyle' (as noted in constraints) allows for any self-chosen movement.

videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Bowing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies an aggressive, dynamic motion involving leg movement directed at another person. The predicted action 'Bowing' is a respectful, static or downward upper-body gesture with no relation to kicking or aggression. The two actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Punching,1.0,"The prediction 'Punching' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'punchsomeone', as both describe the same aggressive physical action."
videos/session_0970_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Handshake,0.8,"A handshake is a specific form of social interaction that commonly occurs during a conversation. While not identical, it is a plausible and contextually relevant component of the broader 'conversation' activity, especially in thermal video where fine verbal cues are absent and physical proximity or gestures may dominate the visual signal."
videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. Dancing is a form of physical exercise and falls within the plausible range of actions for a 'gym' context, especially given that 'freestyle' (as defined) allows any self-chosen movement. Thus, 'dancing' is a specific valid action consistent with the abstract 'gym' label."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth 'gym' implies a dynamic, exercise-related activity. 'Waving' is a distinct, non-exercise gesture that does not fall under typical gym activities or the broader intent of physical exertion associated with 'gym'. It is neither a specific valid action nor a temporal part of such an activity, making it largely inconsistent with the label."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: bending down,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Bending down' is a specific, plausible action that falls within the scope of freestyle behavior, making it a valid and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0974_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. Dancing is a form of physical exercise and falls within the plausible range of actions for a 'gym' context, especially given that 'freestyle' (as noted in constraints) allows for any self-chosen movement. Thus, the prediction is semantically appropriate."
videos/session_0975_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Walking,1.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walking' is a valid, specific action that falls under this abstract label, making the prediction correct."
