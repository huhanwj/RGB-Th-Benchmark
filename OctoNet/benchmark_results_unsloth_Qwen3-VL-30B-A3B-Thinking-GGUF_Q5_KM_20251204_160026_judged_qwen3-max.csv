videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Squat,0.6,"While 'squat' is not an exact match for 'sit', it is a related lower-body action that involves bending at the knees and lowering the body, which can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video. However, squatting is typically a distinct, more active movement than sitting or its immediate transitions (e.g., sitting down or standing up). Given the constraints of thermal video and potential ambiguity, this is a plausible but not fully accurate interpretation, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0002_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Bending down to adjust footwear,0.2,"The ground truth action 'walk' implies continuous locomotion, while the predicted action 'bending down to adjust footwear' is a static, non-locomotive activity that does not represent walking or any logical temporal part of it (e.g., starting or stopping to walk). The actions are semantically unrelated in this context."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a valid and typical posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact lexical match, it is a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jump,0.6,"While 'jump' is not synonymous with 'dance', jumping can be a component of certain dance styles, especially in freestyle or energetic dancing. However, 'jump' alone is less specific and doesn't fully capture the expressive, rhythmic nature typically associated with dancing. Given the abstract and variable nature of 'dance' as a label—especially in a thermal video where fine motion details may be lost—the prediction is plausibly related but not strongly representative, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically adjacent actions. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous pace than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling,1.0,"The prediction 'Falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same physical event with only minor phrasing differences."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Jumping,1.0,The prediction 'Jumping' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jump'.
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jump Rope,0.3,"While both 'jumping jack' and 'jump rope' are dynamic, full-body exercises commonly associated with fitness, they involve distinctly different movement patterns. Jumping jacks require lateral arm and leg abduction/adduction, whereas jump rope involves continuous vertical jumping with wrist rotation for rope turning. The actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal part of the other. However, they belong to the same broad category of aerobic exercises, which justifies a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: squat punch,0.9,"The predicted action 'squat punch' includes 'squat' as a core component, which directly matches the ground truth action. The addition of 'punch' suggests a compound movement that still contains the essential squat motion, making it a semantically valid and specific instance of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, which is distinct from 'walking'. While both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static-dynamic posture characteristic of a lunge and instead describes a different locomotive activity."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not inherently involve turning, nor is it a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending' is related to 'pushup' as pushups involve bending at the elbows and lowering the body, but it is less specific and could describe many other actions (e.g., bending forward, picking something up). While not an exact match or a clear temporal phase of a pushup, it captures a plausible component of the motion, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible interpretation under which walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to a legraise."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements near a surface or in the air. The predicted action 'waving' involves moving the hand or arm back and forth, which is a different motion pattern and intent. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different purposes and kinematics, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: speaking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'boxing' is a dynamic, high-intensity activity involving specific arm and body movements. The predicted action 'speaking' is a completely different, low-energy activity that does not overlap semantically, temporally, or contextually with boxing. There is no plausible scenario where speaking would be considered a part of or equivalent to boxing."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: head turn,0.9,"The predicted action 'head turn' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead'. Both involve deliberate, observable head movement, and in the context of low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing between a lateral head shake and a general head turn may be ambiguous. Given the similarity in motion and intent, this constitutes a near-equivalent match."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Talking on a phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Talking on a phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: phone call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'eat' and the predicted action 'phone call' are completely different activities with no semantic or temporal overlap. Eating involves handling food and consuming it, while a phone call involves communication using a device. There is no plausible scenario where a phone call would be considered a part of or equivalent to eating."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Taking a photo with a mobile device,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drink' involves consuming a beverage, which typically includes holding a cup or bottle and bringing it to the mouth. The predicted action 'Taking a photo with a mobile device' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with drinking. There is no plausible scenario where taking a photo would be considered part of the drinking action, even in low-resolution thermal video."
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Taking a photograph,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'Taking a photograph' implies holding a camera or phone and capturing an image, which is visually and semantically unrelated to wiping one's face. There is no temporal, functional, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Picking up an object from the ground,1.0,The prediction 'Picking up an object from the ground' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'pickup'.
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jump rope,1.0,"The prediction 'jump rope' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumprope', differing only in spacing/formatting."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.85,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are distinct cleaning actions, but they are semantically related in context, purpose, and motion (both involve repetitive, downward arm movements while standing and moving across a floor). Given the low-resolution thermal video, fine-grained distinction between similar cleaning activities may be challenging, and the predicted action is a plausible interpretation of the observed motion pattern."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Talking on the phone,0.0,"The predicted action 'Talking on the phone' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'brushhair'. There is no semantic overlap, temporal relationship, or contextual similarity between the two actions."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving elbow flexion, typically with weights. The predicted action 'Waving' involves arm movement but is fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and context—it is a communicative gesture rather than a resistance exercise. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'Using mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Speaking into a microphone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves a specific hygiene-related activity typically performed near a sink with arm movements close to the face. The predicted action 'Speaking into a microphone' describes a completely different activity involving vocalization and a handheld or mounted device, which is not temporally, semantically, or contextually related to brushing teeth. There is no overlap in motion pattern, intent, or setting that would justify even partial credit."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: using a device,0.9,"The ground truth action 'type' implies interacting with a keyboard or device to input text. The prediction 'using a device' is a semantically appropriate and specific-enough description that aligns well with the intended action, especially given the limitations of low-resolution thermal video which may obscure fine motor details like finger typing."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs-up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs-up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in hyphenation and pluralization, which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, and 'pointing' is not a temporal phase or variant of 'thumbdown'."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Peace sign,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming an 'OK' gesture (thumb and forefinger touching to form a circle), while the predicted action 'Peace sign' describes a different hand gesture (typically index and middle finger raised in a V-shape). These are distinct hand signals with different meanings and finger configurations, making them semantically and visually dissimilar. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Peace sign gesture,1.0,"The predicted action 'Peace sign gesture' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly known as the V-sign or peace sign."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction, likely involving deliberate tracing or gesturing. The predicted action 'Pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion. These actions are fundamentally different in both form and intent, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular movement. These actions are fundamentally different in both form and intent, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: taking a selfie,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding, showing, or interacting with a stop sign, which is a specific static or signaling gesture. The predicted action 'taking a selfie' is a completely different activity with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no reasonable temporal or categorical relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of drawing or pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the hand outward in a directed manner, which is both directionally and functionally opposite. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving,0.3,"'Push hand away' implies a defensive or repelling motion directed outward, often with force or resistance, whereas 'waving' is a friendly, rhythmic side-to-side or up-and-down hand movement typically used for greeting. The two actions differ significantly in intent, directionality, and dynamics. Although both involve hand motion, they are not semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of the same activity."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same specific gesture."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom to clean a surface. The predicted action 'waving' describes a gesture usually directed toward a person and lacks the context or motion pattern of sweeping. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with different intent and motion characteristics. Therefore, this is a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Dancing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'clap' refers to a specific, rhythmic hand movement, while the predicted action 'Dancing' is a broader, different activity. Although dancing may sometimes include clapping, the prediction does not reflect the specific action shown in the clip and is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'clap'. Therefore, it is largely mismatched."
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, movement-based activity (e.g., sliding down a slide or performing a sliding motion), whereas the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture with no motion. This is a generic static description for a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score criteria."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or creating a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and movement patterns, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a dynamic, evasive movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture. This is a generic static label applied to a clearly dynamic action, which falls under the low-score criterion."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' is a specific, dynamic activity involving arm motion and body coordination to roll a ball toward pins. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no meaningful overlap or temporal relationship to bowling. Walking is not a typical preparatory, concurrent, or concluding phase of bowling in a way that would justify partial credit under the temporal partiality rule."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: reaching upwards,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' describes raising one hand upward. The prediction 'reaching upwards' is a semantically equivalent and plausible description of the same motion, as reaching upwards typically involves lifting a hand or arm. The actions are highly aligned in both intent and movement."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: raising arm,0.6,"The ground truth action 'tap' typically involves a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand). The predicted action 'raising arm' is related in that it may be part of the motion leading up to or following a tap, but it does not capture the core interaction implied by 'tap'. It is a plausible but less specific and incomplete representation of the intended action, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching, likely a precise manipulation task. The predicted action 'waving' is a broad arm/hand motion with a different intent and movement pattern. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass the motion or intent of drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different purposes and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'drinking' involves a deliberate hand-to-mouth motion with a container. These actions are anatomically and semantically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0050_cough.mp4,cough,Action: smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'smoking' is a deliberate, sustained behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion. Although both may involve the head/face region and could appear somewhat similar in low-resolution thermal video (e.g., hand near mouth), they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with different intent and physical patterns. There is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often due to impairment or imbalance—whereas 'walking' suggests a controlled, steady motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' misses the key characteristic of instability inherent in 'stagger', making it a related but significantly different action. Thus, it falls into the low-to-medium overlap range, leaning toward low due to the loss of essential semantic nuance."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different activity involving consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are distinct behaviors with different hand-to-face interactions and motion patterns. Coughing does not typically involve using a tissue or the specific head and hand posture associated with blowing one's nose. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent or temporal parts of each other, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: jumping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' refers to deliberate stretching movements, typically slow and static or involving elongation of muscles. The predicted action 'jumping' is a dynamic, high-intensity movement that is not semantically related to stretching. It does not represent a temporal part, a specific instance, or a plausible interpretation of stretching, and thus constitutes a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: talking on the phone,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or face but not necessarily touching the face itself. Although there may be superficial visual similarity in thermal imagery (e.g., hand near head), the actions are semantically distinct and not temporally or categorically related under the given constraints."

videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person. The predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct, non-aggressive gesture with different intent and motion pattern. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, falling into the 'completely different action' category."

videos/session_0064_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending over' is a close semantic and physical approximation of the ground truth 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, this level of specificity is reasonable and captures the essence of the intended action."
videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on back,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying on back' is a highly plausible and common posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, it accurately reflects the physical state typically observed during sleeping, especially in a thermal video where fine details are limited. This constitutes a strong semantic and contextual alignment."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Arm raising,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Arm raising' is a plausible component of dancing and represents a specific motion that could occur during dance. However, it is less specific and may also occur in non-dance contexts, making it related but not fully representative of the broader activity. Hence, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jumping rope,0.6,"Both 'jog' and 'jumping rope' are dynamic, rhythmic physical activities often performed in similar contexts (e.g., exercise or cardio). While not the same action, they are closely related in intent and motion type. However, they are distinct enough that it doesn't qualify as a high-score match, but falls into the medium range due to semantic and functional similarity."
videos/session_0068_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: lying down,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' implies a person transitioning from upright to lying on the ground. The prediction 'lying down' captures the end state of this action and is a semantically valid temporal part of the falling process, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0069_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Jumping rope,1.0,"The prediction 'Jumping rope' is a specific instance of the ground truth action 'jump', which involves repetitive jumping motions. This is a semantically valid and logically consistent interpretation of the label 'jump'."
videos/session_0070_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jump rope,0.6,"Both 'jumping jack' and 'jump rope' are dynamic, full-body exercises commonly performed in fitness contexts, making them semantically related. However, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns—jumping jacks involve lateral arm and leg movements, while jump rope involves vertical jumping with wrist rotation. The prediction is plausible but not a temporal part or exact match of the ground truth, warranting a medium score."

videos/session_0072_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step and bending of the knees, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes a different, continuous locomotive activity. Although both involve leg movement, they are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent. Walking is not a temporal part of performing a lunge, nor is it a valid instantiation of the label 'lunge'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0073_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turning,1.0,"The prediction 'Turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', differing only in capitalization and phrasing, which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending over,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending over' is related to the motion involved in performing a pushup, as pushups involve lowering and raising the body from a prone position, which may appear as bending over in low-resolution thermal video. However, 'bending over' is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., picking something up). It captures part of the movement but lacks the full context of a repetitive, prone upper-body exercise, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0075_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: kicking,0.6,"The ground truth 'legraise' refers to a controlled lifting of the leg, typically from a lying or seated position, often as an abdominal or hip flexor exercise. The prediction 'kicking' involves a dynamic, forceful leg extension, which shares the use of leg movement but differs in intent, form, and typical context. While both involve leg motion, 'kicking' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'legraise', but they are related enough to warrant a medium score."
videos/session_0076_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with arm movements resembling hitting drums. The predicted action 'Clapping' involves striking hands together, which is a different motion pattern and intent. While both involve upper-body movement, they are distinct actions with low semantic or functional overlap in the context of HAR."

videos/session_0085_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Golf Swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'Golf Swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive sweeping motions with a mop, typically close to the ground and using both hands, while a golf swing is a rotational, overhead motion with a club. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0086_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: adjusting hair,0.9,"The predicted action 'adjusting hair' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'brushhair', as both involve actively manipulating or arranging one's hair. While not an exact lexical match, the actions are functionally equivalent in the context of human activity recognition from thermal video, where fine-grained distinctions (e.g., using a brush vs. hands) may not be visually discernible."

videos/session_0089_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a cup or bottle and consuming liquid, which is a different activity with distinct motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with minimal overlap in context or execution."
videos/session_0090_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which involves fine hand/finger movements and is typically performed while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture, not the specific action of typing. While sitting may be the posture during typing, it does not capture the essential action itself. According to the evaluation criteria, using a generic static description for a specific action label like 'type' constitutes a mismatch and warrants a low score."

Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intent and form. Waving is not a temporal part or valid variant of making an OK sign, nor is it a plausible abstraction of it."

The prediction 'arm raise' describes a generic upward movement of the arm, which does not capture the circular or directional nature of the intended action. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action lacks the specificity and motion pattern required by the ground truth, making it largely incorrect."

The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically precede/follow the act of drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a low-similarity match."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Coughing,0.6,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, reflexive respiratory actions that can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of head and torso motion. While not the same action, they are closely related and may be difficult to distinguish under these conditions. However, they are distinct physiological events, so an exact match is not achieved."

videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact lexical match, lying down is a necessary and typical physical state associated with sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent. This constitutes a correct interpretation under temporal and postural reasoning."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: arms raised,0.3,"The ground truth 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic full-body movement. The prediction 'arms raised' describes only a static upper-body pose without indicating motion or dance-like behavior. While raising arms can occur during dancing, the description is too generic and static to reliably indicate the dynamic activity of dancing, especially given the abstract and active nature of the 'dance' label."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically close and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, jogging implies a higher-energy gait than walking, so the prediction is plausible but not fully accurate."
videos/session_0130_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sitting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden loss of balance and collapse to the ground, which is fundamentally different from 'sitting', a controlled and stable posture. While both may result in a person being on the ground or a seated position, the dynamics, intent, and motion patterns are distinct. 'Sitting' does not represent a temporal phase of 'falldown', nor is it semantically equivalent or a plausible misinterpretation under the given constraints."
videos/session_0131_jump.mp4,jump,Action: squat,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both legs leaving the ground, while the predicted action 'squat' is a static or controlled lowering motion that typically keeps the feet on the ground.

The predicted action 'drinking' is a different activity that may involve similar hand-to-mouth motion but is semantically and contextually distinct. While both involve bringing something to the mouth, they are not temporally related phases of the same action nor interchangeable under abstract or partial interpretations. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0152_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'type', which refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard). The predicted action 'sitting' is a static posture and does not capture the essential dynamic component of typing. While a person may be sitting while typing, the core action is the hand/finger movement involved in typing, not the sitting itself. Therefore, the prediction fails to match the intended activity."

The predicted action 'Pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. While both may involve arm movement, pointing lacks the rotational, cyclic nature essential to drawing a circle, making it a largely incorrect interpretation."
videos/session_0158_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Reaching upwards,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a controlled, circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'Reaching upwards' describes a linear, vertical movement that does not resemble or temporally align with drawing a circle.

The prediction 'Raising right arm' could be consistent with holding a stop sign, but without explicit reference to a stop sign or signaling context, it is too generic and ambiguous. Given the specificity of the 'stopsign' label, the predicted action lacks the necessary contextual alignment and is likely a different activity altogether."
videos/session_0160_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: arm raising,0.9,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a movement where the hand or arm is being pulled inward toward the body. The prediction 'arm raising' involves active arm motion and may represent a plausible interpretation of the same gesture, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine directional details (inward vs. upward) can be ambiguous. Given the constraints and the emphasis on action similarity over exact wording, this is considered a strong semantic match."

These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking could be considered part of sneezing or vice versa."
videos/session_0174_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture unrelated to coughing. Even considering temporal partiality or abstraction, 'standing' does not represent a plausible phase or manifestation of coughing, and thus constitutes a completely different action."
videos/session_0175_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait or movement, often suggesting imbalance or difficulty walking. While 'walking' is related in that it involves locomotion, it typically connotes a steady, controlled motion and does not capture the instability inherent in 'stagger'. Therefore, the prediction is partially related but misses a key characteristic of the true action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0176_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0177_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: using a mobile phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'using a mobile phone' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible interpretation under which these two actions are related, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0178_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: raise arms,0.9,"Raising arms is a common and specific movement involved in stretching oneself, making it a semantically appropriate and plausible instance of the ground truth action 'stretchoneself'."
videos/session_0179_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'drinking' typically involves holding a container near the mouth but not necessarily touching the face in the same manner. These are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns, and drinking is not a temporal part or reasonable interpretation of touchface."
videos/session_0180_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'handshake' exactly matches the ground truth action 'handshake', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0181_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0182_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: touching,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a deliberate, forceful physical interaction, while the prediction 'touching' suggests a light or incidental contact. Although both involve physical contact, 'touching' lacks the intent and force characteristic of 'pushing', making it a related but significantly less specific and inaccurate representation of the actual action."
videos/session_0183_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'Kicking' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as kicking is the core action involved in kicking someone. The slight difference in phrasing (gerund vs. verb phrase) does not affect the semantic equivalence in this context."
videos/session_0184_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinctly different gesture—non-aggressive, communicative, and lacking the forceful extension or intent of a punch. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, falling into the 'completely different action' category."
videos/session_0185_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Standing and conversing,1.0,"The prediction 'Standing and conversing' directly includes the core activity 'conversing', which matches the ground truth action 'conversation'. The addition of 'standing' provides contextual detail but does not contradict or dilute the primary action, as conversation can naturally occur while standing."
videos/session_0186_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sitting,1.0,The prediction 'sitting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sit'.
videos/session_0187_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Walking,1.0,The predicted action 'Walking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth 'walk'.
videos/session_0188_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending over' is a close semantic and physical approximation of the ground truth 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, this level of specificity is reasonable and captures the essence of the intended action."
videos/session_0189_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on the ground,0.9,"The ground truth action is 'sleep', which typically involves lying down. The prediction 'Lying on the ground' is a semantically appropriate and highly plausible description of a person sleeping, especially in a thermal video where fine details are absent. While not an exact lexical match, it captures the essential posture and intent of the action."
videos/session_0190_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jumping jacks,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of rhythmic or expressive movements. 'Jumping jacks' is a specific, active movement that could reasonably occur within a freestyle dancing context, especially given the instruction for 'freestyle' to mean any self-chosen action. Therefore, the prediction is a valid instantiation of the broader 'dance' category."
videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that share visual similarities, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details (like gait speed) may be ambiguous. However, they are distinct actions in terms of intensity and typical classification—jogging implies a faster, more vigorous pace than walking. Since the prediction is plausible but not semantically equivalent or a clear temporal part of 'jog', it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0192_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: forward roll,0.3,"While both 'falldown' and 'forward roll' involve a person moving toward the ground, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. A forward roll is a controlled, acrobatic movement, whereas 'falldown' implies an uncontrolled or accidental collapse. The VLM's prediction does not represent a temporal phase of falling down, nor is it a plausible synonym or specific instance of the ground truth label."
videos/session_0193_jump.mp4,jump,Action: raise arms,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, full-body movement involving elevation off the ground. The predicted action 'raise arms' is an upper-body motion that may occur during a jump but is not sufficient to constitute jumping on its own. It is a partial and non-diagnostic component of the action, and without evidence of leg movement or elevation, it does not capture the essence of 'jump'. Therefore, it is considered a low-match prediction."

videos/session_0197_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking in a circle,0.9,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a change in direction or orientation. 'Walking in a circle' inherently involves continuous turning, making it a semantically valid and contextually appropriate interpretation of the action, especially given the temporal and low-resolution constraints of the input video."
videos/session_0198_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Bending Over,0.6,"While 'bending over' is not an exact match for 'pushup', it describes a posture that can occur during the downward phase of a pushup. However, 'bending over' is more generic and could refer to many non-pushup actions (e.g., picking something up), making it related but less specific. Thus, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0199_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible scenario where walking constitutes a part of or equivalent to performing a legraise."
videos/session_0200_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: adjusting face mask,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'adjusting face mask' is a completely unrelated static gesture with no semantic or temporal overlap with airdrumming. This constitutes a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0201_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: shooting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic upper-body movements such as punching, blocking, or footwork specific to the sport. The predicted action 'shooting' typically refers to actions like shooting a gun or a basketball, which are visually and semantically distinct from boxing. There is no significant overlap in motion patterns or intent, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0202_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion.

videos/session_0204_eat.mp4,eat,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'eat', which involves consuming food, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' is a completely unrelated activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where talking on the phone would be considered a part of or equivalent to eating."
videos/session_0205_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0206_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: covering face with hands,0.9,"The predicted action 'covering face with hands' is a highly plausible and semantically close representation of 'wipeface', as both involve using hands to touch or move across the face. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, fine-grained distinctions (e.g., wiping vs. covering) are difficult, and the actions share strong functional and spatial overlap."
videos/session_0207_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending' is a logical and common component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking up an object typically involves bending down. This aligns with the temporal partiality criterion, where a constituent motion of the labeled activity is considered correct."
videos/session_0208_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: arm swing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a specific, dynamic activity that involves coordinated full-body movement, particularly jumping and arm swinging with a rope. While 'arm swing' is a component of jump roping, it is overly partial and non-specific on its own—it could describe many other activities (e.g., walking, warming up, or even unrelated gestures). Given the clarity and specificity of the 'jumprope' label, predicting only 'arm swing' fails to capture the essential nature of the activity and falls into the low-score range for being too generic and incomplete."
videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are highly similar cleaning actions involving repetitive arm movements and handling of a long-handled tool. While not identical, they are semantically close in context and motion pattern, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained distinctions (e.g., wet vs. dry cleaning) may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is considered nearly equivalent."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: hair adjustment,0.9,"The predicted action 'hair adjustment' is a semantically close and reasonable interpretation of the ground truth 'brushhair', especially given the limitations of low-resolution thermal video which may obscure fine details like brushing. Hair adjustment encompasses actions such as brushing, smoothing, or tidying hair, making it a valid equivalent in this context."
videos/session_0211_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving elbow flexion, typically with weights. The predicted action 'pointing' is a completely different gesture involving arm extension and finger direction, with no biomechanical or semantic overlap. There is no temporal or contextual relationship between pointing and performing a bicep curl, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0212_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically while holding it in hand and looking at the screen. The predicted action 'Eating' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where eating is a part of or equivalent to playing with a phone."
videos/session_0213_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a cup or bottle and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, object used, and motion dynamics are sufficiently dissimilar to consider this a mismatch."
videos/session_0214_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements typically while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. Although sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual task being performed, especially since 'type' is a specific action rather than an abstract or dynamic category like 'gym'. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0215_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in phrasing (pluralization and spacing), which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0216_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct intent and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no significant overlap or temporal relationship."
videos/session_0217_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Making a peace sign with hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers specifically to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle), whereas the predicted action describes making a 'peace sign' (typically index and middle finger raised). These are distinct hand gestures with different configurations and meanings, so the prediction is semantically incorrect despite being hand-related."
videos/session_0218_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the index and middle fingers in a V shape), while the predicted action 'pointing' involves extending a single finger to indicate direction or focus. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct gestures with different intents and configurations. The prediction does not capture the essence of the victory sign and is not a temporal part or valid variant of it."
videos/session_0219_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a controlled, circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction, likely performed while stationary. The predicted action 'throwing' involves a rapid, linear or arc-like motion typically aimed at propelling an object away, which is fundamentally different in intent, trajectory, and dynamics. There is no significant semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0220_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The predicted action 'pointing' is a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically unrelated to drawing circles. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would make pointing a valid part of drawing a counter-clockwise circle."
videos/session_0221_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies a person is holding or presenting a stop sign, which typically involves standing still with the sign raised. While 'raising arm' could be part of that motion, it is too generic and does not specifically indicate interaction with a stop sign. Without explicit reference to a stop sign or its functional equivalent, the prediction is only weakly related and likely describes a different action altogether."
videos/session_0222_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: checking watch,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific movement involving pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body. The predicted action 'checking watch' involves looking at a wristwatch, which is a distinct and unrelated gesture. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, and 'checking watch' does not represent a plausible part or interpretation of 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0223_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or pushing another person's hand away. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a fundamentally different hand gesture with distinct intent and motion. There is no significant semantic overlap or temporal relationship between pointing and pushing a hand away, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0224_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: raise arm,0.9,"Raising an arm is a core component of handwaving, as handwaving typically involves lifting the arm and moving the hand. The prediction captures the essential motion implied by the ground truth 'handwave', making it semantically equivalent in this context."
videos/session_0225_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a characteristic repetitive arm motion with a broom or similar tool, typically covering a floor area. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a static or brief gesture directed at an object or direction and shares no meaningful semantic, functional, or temporal relationship with sweeping. It is a completely different action category."

videos/session_0227_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or crouched position (e.g., on a slide or floor). The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement and is semantically unrelated to sliding. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between waving and sliding, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0228_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0229_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden shifts in body position. The predicted action 'walking' is a steady, forward locomotion and does not capture the dynamic, reactive nature of dodging. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern."
videos/session_0230_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: bending,0.6,"Bending is a plausible component of the bowling action (e.g., during the approach or release phase), but it is not specific enough to fully capture the distinct motion pattern of bowling. While related, it lacks key elements like arm swing or ball release, placing it in the medium-similarity range."

These actions differ significantly in intent, motion pattern, and body part involved, making them semantically unrelated."
videos/session_0233_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: raise arm,0.2,The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together. The predicted action 'raise arm' describes a completely different movement that does not involve the fine motor actions of the hand implied by the label. There is no significant semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions.
videos/session_0234_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically precede/partake in drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

In thermal video clips, especially short ones, it is common to observe the posture associated with sleeping (i.e., lying down) rather than definitive signs of being asleep. Given the context and constraints, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid representation of the 'sleep' action."
videos/session_0252_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Jumping Jacks,0.9,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of rhythmic or expressive movements. 'Jumping Jacks' is a specific, active movement that could reasonably occur within a freestyle dance context, especially given the instruction for 'freestyle' to mean any self-chosen action.

videos/session_0270_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jogging in place,0.3,"While both 'jumprope' and 'jogging in place' are dynamic, rhythmic, lower-body exercises often performed in similar contexts (e.g., warm-ups or cardio), they involve distinctly different movement patterns: jumprope requires coordinated arm and leg motion with a rope, whereas jogging in place lacks the upper-body component and rope interaction. The VLM's prediction is related but not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or valid instantiation of 'jumprope', warranting a low score."
videos/session_0271_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: mopping,1.0,"The prediction 'mopping' is a direct and semantically equivalent match to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor', as both describe the same core activity of cleaning a floor with a mop."

The predicted action 'Eating' is a fundamentally different activity involving ingestion of food, which has distinct motion patterns and intent. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between brushing teeth and eating, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0276_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'type', which refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard). The predicted action 'sitting' is a static posture and does not capture the specific dynamic action of typing. While sitting may be the physical state during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual activity indicated by the label 'type'. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect."

There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0285_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension toward a direction or object, with no inherent implication of repulsion or contact. These actions differ significantly in intent, motion, and physical interaction, making the prediction largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0286_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Hand raise,0.9,"The predicted action 'Hand raise' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'handwave'. Both involve deliberate upward or visible arm movement, and in low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing between a wave and a raise can be ambiguous. Given the context of HAR and the allowance for semantic equivalence, this is considered a correct interpretation."
videos/session_0287_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping.

videos/session_0294_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand), while the predicted action 'Pointing' involves extending a finger to indicate direction or location. Although both involve hand gestures, they serve different purposes and have distinct motion patterns; pointing is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of tapping. Thus, the actions are related at a very general level (hand movement) but not sufficiently aligned for a higher score."
videos/session_0295_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching (likely thumb and finger), which is distinct from 'pointing'. While both involve hand use, pointing typically uses an extended index finger without the spreading or pinching motion. The actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is pointing a temporal phase of spread-and-pinch. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0298_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Coughing,1.0,"The prediction 'Coughing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'cough', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0299_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty walking. While 'walking' is related in that it involves locomotion, it suggests a steady, controlled motion, which does not capture the essential characteristic of staggering. Therefore, the prediction is partially related but misses the key nuance of instability, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0300_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: talking on mobile phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a distinct facial and bodily gesture associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'talking on mobile phone' describes a completely different behavior with no semantic or temporal overlap.

The two actions involve opposite intents and body movements, with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0306_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Boxing,0.6,"While 'boxing' involves pushing-like motions (e.g., punching), it is not semantically equivalent to 'pushsomeone', which implies direct physical contact to move another person. However, both involve forceful upper-body interaction, making them related but not exact. This falls into the medium score range due to plausible but ambiguous overlap."
videos/session_0307_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'Kicking' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as kicking someone inherently involves the action of kicking.

videos/session_0314_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement, while the predicted action 'Walking' is a fundamentally different type of locomotion without the expressive or rhythmic qualities associated with dancing. Walking is not a temporal part, specific instance, or semantic equivalent of dancing, nor is it a valid instantiation under an abstract label like 'freestyle' in this context. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0315_jog.mp4,jog,Action: running,1.0,"The predicted action 'running' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'jog', as both describe similar forms of rapid locomotion on foot, differing only in intensity.

'Dancing' is a broad category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent nor a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the clip shows dance-specific movements, this prediction is too divergent from the specific GT action to warrant a higher score."

The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the hand outward and is directionally and functionally opposite to 'pulling in.' These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same broader category, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0347_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or defensive motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a friendly or communicative gesture involving hand movement. While both involve hand motion, the intent and motion pattern are fundamentally different, making this a mismatch rather than a temporal or semantic variant."
videos/session_0348_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sitting down,1.0,"The prediction 'sitting down' is a direct and logical temporal part of the ground truth action 'sit', which includes both the act of sitting down and being seated."

videos/session_0350_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending over,0.9,"The prediction 'bending over' is a close semantic and physical approximation of the ground truth action 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, this level of detail is reasonable and aligns with the intended action."
videos/session_0351_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a valid and typical posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and common component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details may be absent. This constitutes a strong semantic and behavioral alignment."
videos/session_0352_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Dancing,1.0,"The predicted action 'Dancing' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth 'dance', differing only in capitalization and phrasing, which does not affect meaning."
videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically adjacent actions. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous pace than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0354_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' implies a person losing balance and ending up on the ground. 'Lying down' is a plausible end state of a fall, especially in a short thermal clip where the actual falling motion might not be fully captured. Given the temporal partiality allowance, this is a semantically reasonable match."

videos/session_0358_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward or backward step with bent knees, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes a different, rhythmic gait pattern. Although both involve leg movement, they are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent. Walking is not a temporal part of performing a lunge, nor is it a valid instantiation of the label 'lunge'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0359_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The prediction 'turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', representing the same activity with only minor grammatical variation."
videos/session_0360_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: crab,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise performed in a prone position. The predicted action 'crab' likely refers to a 'crab walk' or similar movement, which involves a different body posture (sitting with hands and feet on the ground, hips raised) and motion pattern. While both are exercises, they are distinct and not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal part of the other. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0361_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: kicking,0.6,"The ground truth 'legraise' refers to a controlled lifting of the leg, typically from a lying or seated position, often as an abdominal or hip-flexor exercise. The prediction 'kicking' involves a more dynamic, forceful leg extension, usually while standing. While both involve leg movement, kicking is not a typical temporal phase of a legraise and implies a different intent and motion pattern. However, they are somewhat related as lower-body actions, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0362_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: talking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving active arm movements. The predicted action 'talking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap.

videos/session_0368_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: sneezing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a deliberate hand-to-face motion to clean or dry the face, while 'sneezing' is an involuntary reflex that may involve covering the face but is fundamentally a different action. Although both involve the face, they are semantically and behaviorally distinct, with no strong temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0369_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending forward,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending forward' is a core component of the 'pickup' action, as picking something up typically involves bending forward to reach an object on the ground or a surface. This aligns with the temporal partiality criterion, where a logical sub-movement of the labeled action is considered correct."
videos/session_0370_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jump Rope,1.0,The prediction 'Jump Rope' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'jumprope'.
videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: golf swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'golf swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive sweeping motions with a mop, typically close to the ground and using both hands, while a golf swing is a rotational, overhead striking motion with a club. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0372_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Adjusting hat,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming behavior focused on the hair, while the predicted action 'Adjusting hat' relates to manipulating a headwear item. These are distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns; adjusting a hat is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing hair."

The predicted action 'adjusting mask' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no indication that adjusting a mask is part of or related to playing with a phone, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0375_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' is a different activity that may involve similar hand-to-mouth motion but is semantically and contextually distinct. While both involve bringing something to the mouth, they are not temporally related phases of the same action nor interchangeable under abstract labels. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0376_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which involves fine hand/finger movements and is typically performed while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture, not the specific action of typing. While sitting may be the context in which typing occurs, it does not capture the actual activity labeled as 'type'. Therefore, the prediction is too generic and misses the core action, resulting in a low score."
videos/session_0377_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in phrasing (pluralization and spacing), which does not affect the meaning."

Although both involve hand motion, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intent and form, and waving is not a temporal or contextual part of making an OK sign."
videos/session_0380_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: peace sign,1.0,"The predicted action 'peace sign' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly known as the V-sign or victory/peace symbol."
videos/session_0381_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: raise arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'raise arm' describes a generic upward arm movement, which does not capture the circular or directional nature of the intended action. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action lacks the specificity and motion pattern required to be considered a temporal part or semantic equivalent of drawing a circle clockwise."
videos/session_0382_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: raise arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'raise arm' describes a generic upward arm movement, which does not capture the circular or directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action lacks the specificity and motion pattern required by the ground truth, making it largely inconsistent."
videos/session_0383_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap. There is no indication that waving is a temporal part or valid interpretation of 'stopsign'."
videos/session_0384_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The predicted action 'waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a greeting or signaling motion, which is kinematically and semantically distinct. While both involve hand movement, they are not temporally related phases nor semantically equivalent, and 'waving' does not plausibly represent a part or variant of 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0385_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"'Pushing hand away' implies a defensive or repelling motion directed outward, often with force or resistance, while 'waving' is a friendly, rhythmic side-to-side or up-and-down motion typically used for greeting. These actions differ significantly in intent, directionality, and movement pattern. Although both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically and functionally distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0386_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', describing the same specific gesture."
videos/session_0387_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping.

videos/session_0388_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Taking a photo,0.1,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves rhythmic hand movements bringing palms together, while the predicted action 'Taking a photo' typically involves holding a device and pressing a button—these are visually and semantically distinct actions with little overlap in motion or intent. There is no temporal or contextual relationship that would make one a valid interpretation of the other."
videos/session_0389_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or crouched position (e.g., on a slide or floor). The predicted action 'waving' involves arm motion and is semantically unrelated to sliding. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between waving and sliding, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0390_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific, controlled hand or body motion tracing a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor movement. The predicted action 'waving' is a broad, rhythmic arm motion that does not resemble the precise, directional changes characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no strong temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0391_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving sidestepping, ducking, or sudden directional changes. The predicted action 'walking' describes a slow, steady, and non-evasive gait, which is semantically and behaviorally distinct from dodging. There is no temporal or contextual overlap that would make walking a reasonable part of the dodge action."
videos/session_0392_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Punching,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including approach, swing, and release of a ball, typically with one arm in a forward arc motion. 'Punching' is a fundamentally different action involving rapid extension of the fist toward a target, often in a combat or exercise context. The two actions share no significant semantic or kinematic overlap, and punching is not a plausible temporal segment or variant of bowling. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0394_tap.mp4,tap,Action: checking the watch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, deliberate contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the prediction 'checking the watch' describes a different, more specific interaction. Although both involve hand movement near the wrist, 'checking the watch' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'tap'. The actions are related in context but not sufficiently aligned to warrant a medium or high score."
videos/session_0395_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0396_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, controlled hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape. The predicted action 'waving' is a different, rhythmic arm motion with no clear relation to drawing a geometric figure.

videos/session_0398_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Speaking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, short-duration respiratory action, while the predicted action 'Speaking' is a distinct vocal activity. Although both involve the upper body and may appear somewhat similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are semantically and physically different actions with different intent and motion patterns. There is no strong evidence that speaking is a temporal part or semantic equivalent of coughing, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0399_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often due to impairment or imbalance—whereas 'walking' suggests a controlled, steady motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' misses the key characteristic of instability inherent in 'staggering', making it a related but significantly different action. Thus, it falls into the low-to-mid range; however, given the distinct nature of staggering versus normal walking, it is closer to a low score."
videos/session_0400_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different behavior involving liquid consumption.

videos/session_0403_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: making a phone call,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, such as scratching, rubbing, or adjusting glasses. The predicted action 'making a phone call' typically involves holding a phone to the ear or face, which may sometimes resemble touching the face, but it represents a distinct and specific activity with different intent and motion pattern. Given the low-resolution thermal context, some ambiguity is possible, but 'making a phone call' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'touchface', nor is it a plausible generalization. Thus, the actions are largely dissimilar."

While not exact matches, they are semantically close and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, jogging implies a higher-energy gait than walking, so the prediction is plausible but not fully accurate."
videos/session_0416_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Push-up,0.0,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'Push-up' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while on the ground, involving upper body movement. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and physical posture. A push-up does not represent any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of falling down, nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract labeling. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."

videos/session_0459_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: head turn,0.9,"The predicted action 'head turn' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead'. Both involve deliberate, observable head movement, and in the context of low-resolution thermal video, distinguishing between a lateral head shake and a general head turn may be ambiguous. Given the similarity in motion and body part involved, this constitutes a near-equivalent interpretation."
videos/session_0460_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: talking on the phone,1.0,"The prediction 'talking on the phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."

The predicted action 'Eating' is a completely different activity that typically involves hand-to-mouth motion but is not semantically equivalent or temporally related to touching one's face. While both may involve hand movement near the face, the intent and motion are different enough to constitute a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0526_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending over,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending over' is related to 'pushup' as a pushup involves bending the elbows and lowering the body, which may appear as bending over in a low-resolution thermal video. However, 'bending over' is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., picking something up), so it doesn't fully capture the distinct repetitive, prone nature of a pushup. This warrants a medium score."
videos/session_0527_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Shaking hands,1.0,The prediction 'Shaking hands' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handshake'.
videos/session_0528_hug.mp4,hug,Action: hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0529_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: kick,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' involves direct physical contact where one person exerts force to move another. The predicted action 'kick' is a different type of aggressive or dynamic interaction involving the legs, not pushing with hands or body. While both are interpersonal actions, they are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap in this context."
videos/session_0530_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'Kicking' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it captures the core physical action involved."
videos/session_0531_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' is a dynamic, aggressive movement involving striking another person. The prediction 'standing' describes a static, neutral posture with no indication of motion or interaction. This is a generic static label applied to a clearly dynamic and specific action, which falls under the low-score category per the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0532_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Talking,1.0,"The prediction 'Talking' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'conversation', as conversation inherently involves talking between individuals."
videos/session_0533_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sitting,1.0,The prediction 'sitting' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'sit'.
videos/session_0534_walk.mp4,walk,Action: walking,1.0,The predicted action 'walking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'walk'.
videos/session_0535_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. Given the thermal, low-resolution nature of the video and the temporal partiality allowance, this is a semantically valid and temporally plausible interpretation."
videos/session_0536_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a valid and typical posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact lexical match, it is semantically appropriate and aligns with common physical manifestations of sleeping, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine details are unavailable."
videos/session_0537_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jumping jacks,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of rhythmic or expressive movements. 'Jumping jacks' is a specific, active movement that could reasonably occur within a freestyle dancing context, especially given the instruction for 'freestyle' to mean any self-chosen action. Therefore, the prediction is a valid instantiation of the broader 'dance' category."
videos/session_0538_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that share visual similarities, especially in low-resolution thermal video where gait speed may be hard to distinguish. However, they are not semantically equivalent nor is walking a necessary temporal part of jogging. The prediction is plausible but less specific and slightly inaccurate for the ground truth 'jog'."
videos/session_0539_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: lying down,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' implies a person losing balance and ending up on the ground, which typically results in a 'lying down' posture. While 'lying down' is a static state and 'falldown' is dynamic, the predicted action represents the immediate and expected outcome of the fall, making it a semantically valid and temporally plausible interpretation given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video."
videos/session_0540_jump.mp4,jump,Action: dancing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a specific, dynamic movement involving propulsion off the ground. 'Dancing' is a broad category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent or a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the clip shows dancing that prominently features jumping, the prediction is too generic and misaligned with the specific GT label."
videos/session_0541_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a specific dynamic exercise involving jumping with coordinated arm and leg movements. The prediction 'jumping' captures the core dynamic component of the action—vertical movement through jumping—even if it omits the full-body coordination typical of jumping jacks. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the emphasis on semantic similarity over exactness, this is a highly plausible and closely related interpretation."
videos/session_0542_squat.mp4,squat,Action: squat,1.0,"The predicted action 'squat' exactly matches the ground truth action 'squat', indicating a precise and correct recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0543_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: running,0.1,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward or backward step with bending knees, while the predicted action 'running' is a completely different dynamic activity involving continuous strides. Although both are forms of exercise, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or specific instances of each other. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0544_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The prediction 'turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', representing the same activity with only minor grammatical variation."
videos/session_0545_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: push-up,1.0,"The prediction 'push-up' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'pushup', differing only in hyphenation, which does not affect meaning."
videos/session_0546_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: kicking,0.6,"The ground truth 'legraise' refers to a controlled lifting of the leg, typically from a lying or seated position, often as an abdominal or hip-flexor exercise. The prediction 'kicking' involves a dynamic, forceful leg extension, which shares the use of leg movement but differs in intent, form, and typical context. While both involve leg motion, kicking is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of legraise, but they are related enough to warrant a medium score."
videos/session_0547_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Punching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements near a surface or in the air. The predicted action 'Punching' involves forceful forward arm thrusts, which are kinematically and semantically distinct from drumming gestures. While both involve arm motion, the intent, pattern, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0548_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Putting on a hat,0.0,"The predicted action 'Putting on a hat' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'boxing'. Boxing involves dynamic upper-body movements such as punching, while putting on a hat is a distinct, non-combative gesture with no semantic or temporal overlap with boxing."
videos/session_0549_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Turning,0.9,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' involves rotating or moving the head laterally or vertically. 'Turning' is a semantically related and plausible description of this motion, especially in a low-resolution thermal video where fine head movements may appear as general turning. The actions are sufficiently similar in intent and execution to warrant a high score."
videos/session_0550_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: sneezing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication. 'Sneezing' is a completely unrelated physiological reflex with no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap with answering a phone. There is no plausible scenario where sneezing constitutes a part of or an equivalent to answering a phone."
videos/session_0551_eat.mp4,eat,Action: making a phone call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'eat' and the predicted action 'making a phone call' are completely different activities with no semantic or temporal overlap. Eating involves hand-to-mouth movements and typically interaction with food, while making a phone call involves holding a device to the ear or face—distinct actions in both intent and motion. There is no plausible scenario where one is a temporal part or equivalent of the other."
videos/session_0552_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The prediction 'drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0553_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'Eating' implies bringing food to the mouth and chewing, which is a completely different activity with different motion patterns and intent. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0554_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Tying shoelaces,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pickup' involves lifting or retrieving an object from a surface, while 'tying shoelaces' is a distinct fine-motor activity typically performed while seated or crouched and does not involve picking up an object in the intended sense. The two actions are semantically and functionally different, with no significant temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0555_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping rope,1.0,The prediction 'Jumping rope' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumprope'.
videos/session_0556_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.6,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are distinct cleaning actions involving different tools and motions; however, they are semantically related as floor-cleaning activities. While not equivalent, the prediction shows reasonable contextual understanding but lacks action specificity, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0557_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (e.g., a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion usually in response to an itch. The VLM's prediction does not capture the essence or typical execution of the ground truth action, making it a related but incorrect interpretation."
videos/session_0558_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow, typically with weights. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and context—it is a communicative gesture rather than a resistance exercise. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0559_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0560_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Eating,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves a specific hygiene-related activity typically performed near a sink with arm movements close to the face, while the predicted action 'Eating' is a fundamentally different behavior involving food consumption. These actions are not semantically related, nor do they share temporal or contextual overlap in typical scenarios."
videos/session_0561_type.mp4,type,Action: using mobile device,0.2,"The ground truth action 'type' implies using a keyboard or similar input device, while the prediction 'using mobile device' suggests interaction with a phone or tablet. Although both involve manual interaction with a device, typing typically refers to keyboard-based input (e.g., on a computer), which is semantically distinct from general mobile device usage (e.g., swiping, tapping apps). The actions are related but not sufficiently aligned given the specificity of 'type' as a label."
videos/session_0562_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'Thumbs up' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in capitalization and phrasing."
videos/session_0563_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: saluting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'saluting' is a distinct and unrelated hand/arm gesture typically associated with respect or military protocol. The two actions involve different hand configurations and semantic meanings, making them fundamentally dissimilar."
videos/session_0564_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: making peace sign,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers specifically to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (thumb and index finger touching to form a circle), whereas the predicted action 'making peace sign' describes a different hand gesture (typically index and middle finger raised in a V-shape). These are distinct, non-overlapping gestures with different meanings and finger configurations, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0565_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a peace sign,1.0,"Making a peace sign is semantically equivalent to making a victory sign, as both refer to the same hand gesture (V-sign) commonly used interchangeably in casual contexts."
videos/session_0566_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular movement. These actions are fundamentally different in both form and intent, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0567_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The predicted action 'Waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically side-to-side or up-and-down—and does not capture the circular, directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0568_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: taking a selfie,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding, displaying, or interacting with a stop sign, which is a specific and static gesture. The predicted action 'taking a selfie' involves a completely different activity with no semantic or contextual overlap—there is no plausible scenario where taking a selfie would be considered a valid temporal part, equivalent, or related action to presenting a stop sign."
videos/session_0569_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: speaking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward, likely toward the body. The predicted action 'speaking' is unrelated and does not correspond to any plausible temporal phase or semantic equivalent of the ground truth. Speaking typically involves minimal hand motion and is inconsistent with the dynamic nature implied by 'pullhandin'."
videos/session_0570_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, defensive or repelling motion involving the hands, likely pushing something or someone away. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinct hand gesture with a different intent and motion pattern, not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of pushing away. The two actions are functionally and kinematically dissimilar."
videos/session_0571_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."
videos/session_0572_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a gesture usually directed toward a person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct in both intent and movement, especially in a thermal video where tool use may not be visible but motion dynamics differ significantly."

videos/session_0574_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or crouched position (e.g., on a slide, floor, or snow). The predicted action 'Pointing' is a static upper-body gesture with no meaningful overlap in motion, intent, or physical posture. There is no temporal or semantic relationship between pointing and sliding, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0575_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Saluting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving hand/arm movement to create a zigzag pattern, likely while stationary. The predicted action 'Saluting' is a distinct, unrelated gesture with different intent and motion pattern. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between saluting and drawing a zigzag, even considering the low-resolution thermal video constraints."
videos/session_0576_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position or direction. The predicted action 'turning' is related, as turning can be part of a dodging motion, but it is less specific and does not fully capture the intent or dynamics of dodging. Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap."
videos/session_0577_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: throwing,0.9,"The predicted action 'throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves the act of throwing a ball. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on temporal partiality, this prediction accurately captures the essential motion of the activity."
videos/session_0578_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'pointing', which typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger. Given the low-resolution thermal video context and the similarity in motion and intent, this prediction is a reasonable and specific interpretation of the action."
videos/session_0579_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Smoking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'tap' refers to a brief, light touch or contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the predicted action 'Smoking' describes a completely unrelated activity involving inhaling smoke.

The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is fundamentally different in both form and intent. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between waving and the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'."
videos/session_0581_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, controlled hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The predicted action 'waving' is a generic, rhythmic arm motion that does not resemble the geometric precision or intent of drawing a triangle. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in form or purpose."
videos/session_0582_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'Eating' involves deliberate hand-to-mouth movements and chewing. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0583_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture unrelated to coughing. Coughing may occur while standing, but 'standing' alone fails to capture the essential action and is too generic for this clearly defined dynamic label."
videos/session_0584_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking towards the camera,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking. The prediction 'walking towards the camera' describes a normal, controlled walking motion, which is semantically distinct from staggering. While both involve locomotion, the manner of movement is fundamentally different, making this a near-complete mismatch."

videos/session_0586_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: covering face,0.6,"The predicted action 'covering face' is related to 'blownose', as blowing one's nose often involves bringing a hand or tissue to the face, which may appear as covering the face in low-resolution thermal video. However, 'covering face' is less specific and could refer to other behaviors (e.g., shielding from light, expressing emotion), so it does not fully capture the intended action."
videos/session_0587_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: putting on a hat,0.0,"The predicted action 'putting on a hat' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'stretchoneself'. Stretching oneself involves extending or lengthening the body or limbs, while putting on a hat is a distinct upper-body gesture with no semantic or temporal overlap with stretching."
videos/session_0588_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Coughing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves deliberate contact with the face, while 'coughing'—though it may sometimes involve hand-to-face motion—is a distinct respiratory action and not a semantic or temporal part of 'touchface'. The two actions are not equivalent, nor is coughing a specific instance or phase of touching the face. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."

The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different activity that does not align with the core nature of 'conversation'. While someone might walk while talking, in the context of HAR datasets, 'conversation' usually refers to stationary or minimally mobile interaction. Thus, this is a mismatch."
videos/session_0595_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of light exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and not strongly indicative of typical gym-related actions like weightlifting or intense training. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but generic activity."

videos/session_0604_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: sitting,0.2,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing any self-chosen active movement, which implies dynamic activity. The prediction 'sitting' describes a static, inactive posture that does not align with the expected nature of 'freestyle' in this context, unless the video clearly showed inactivity—which is unlikely given the label. Therefore, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0605_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.9,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Dancing' is a dynamic, active movement that falls within the broad scope of physical exercise consistent with a 'gym' context, especially given that 'freestyle' (as defined) allows for any self-chosen action. Thus, the prediction is a valid specific instance of the abstract label."

videos/session_0670_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are visually and semantically dissimilar, especially in a thermal video where contextual cues are limited."
videos/session_0671_clap.mp4,clap,Action: waving,0.3,"While both 'clap' and 'waving' involve hand movements, they are distinct actions with different motion patterns and intent. Clapping involves bringing hands together repeatedly in front of the body, whereas waving typically involves moving one or both hands side-to-side or up-and-down to signal. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is waving a temporal part of clapping. Thus, the prediction is partially related but incorrect for the given ground truth."
videos/session_0672_slide.mp4,slide,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a distinct movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, often in a seated or crouched position (e.g., on a slide or floor). 'Walking' is a fundamentally different locomotive action with a different gait and posture, and it is not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of sliding. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0678_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, likely in a controlled or deliberate manner. The predicted action 'Waving' is a broad arm/hand motion used for greeting or signaling, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is minimal overlap in motion pattern or intent, making this a largely incorrect prediction."

The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically lead into drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0680_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: touching face,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, reflexive action typically involving a sudden expulsion of air through the nose and mouth, often accompanied by covering the face. While 'touching face' might occasionally co-occur (e.g., covering the nose during a sneeze), it is not a defining or temporally integral part of sneezing. The predicted action is too generic and could describe many unrelated behaviors, making it largely inconsistent with the specific ground truth."
videos/session_0681_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture unrelated to coughing. Even considering temporal partiality or abstraction, 'standing' does not represent a plausible part or manifestation of coughing, and thus constitutes a nearly complete mismatch."
videos/session_0682_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a steady, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical instability inherent to 'staggering,' making it a significantly different action rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."

The predicted action 'Eating' involves deliberate ingestion of food, which is visually and semantically distinct from yawning. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions, and 'eating' is not a plausible part or misinterpretation of 'yawn' in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0684_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct and specific upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is visually and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions, and neither is a plausible part of the other."
videos/session_0685_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: arm raise,0.9,"The predicted action 'arm raise' is a specific movement that falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself', as raising one's arms is a common and valid form of stretching. The prediction captures a semantically relevant and plausible instance of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0686_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: talking on the phone,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'talking on the phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or face but does not necessarily include touching the face itself. Although there may be slight overlap in hand-to-head proximity, the core actions are semantically distinct and not temporally or categorically related under the given constraints."

videos/session_0690_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kicking,1.0,"The prediction 'kicking' is a direct and semantically equivalent description of the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it captures the core physical motion involved in the labeled activity."
videos/session_0691_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, directed physical movement toward another person, while the predicted action 'Waving' is a friendly, non-aggressive gesture. These actions are semantically and behaviorally distinct, with no meaningful overlap in intent or motion pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0692_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: talking,1.0,"The prediction 'talking' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'conversation', as conversation inherently involves talking between individuals."

videos/session_0697_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending over' is a close semantic and physical approximation of the ground truth 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. Given the low-resolution thermal video context, this level of specificity is reasonable and captures the essence of the action."
videos/session_0698_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a valid and typical posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and common component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine-grained cues are limited. Thus, it qualifies as a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible part of the sleep action."
videos/session_0699_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement, while the predicted action 'Walking' is a fundamentally different type of locomotion with distinct motion patterns. Walking is not a temporal part of dancing nor a specific instance of it, and does not fall under the semantic scope of 'dance' as an abstract or high-level activity label."
videos/session_0700_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically close and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, jogging implies a higher-energy gait than walking, so the prediction is plausible but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0701_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: push-up,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'push-up' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while on the ground, involving upper body movement. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion dynamics, and posture. A push-up does not represent any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of falling down, nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract or partial observation constraints."
videos/session_0702_jump.mp4,jump,Action: dancing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a specific, dynamic movement involving propulsion off the ground. 'Dancing' is a broad category that may include jumping but is not semantically equivalent nor a necessary temporal part of jumping. Without evidence that the thermal clip shows dance-specific motions, this prediction is only loosely related and overly generic for a precise label like 'jump'."
videos/session_0703_gym.mp4,gym,Action: arm circles,0.9,"The ground truth label 'gym' is an abstract category encompassing various exercise-related movements.

The actions are fundamentally distinct in motion pattern and intent."
videos/session_0794_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The predicted action 'waving' is a different gesture altogether and does not correspond to the expected behavior associated with a stop sign. While both involve arm movement, the intent and context are distinct, making this a mismatch."
videos/session_0795_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific upper-body movement involving pulling the hand inward (e.g., during resistance exercise or a controlled arm motion). The predicted action 'drinking' involves a distinct gesture—bringing a container to the mouth—which is unrelated in form, intent, and motion pattern. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0796_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a deliberate pushing motion directed away from the body, likely involving force or resistance. In contrast, 'waving' is a rhythmic, side-to-side or up-and-down hand movement typically used for greeting or signaling, which lacks the directional intent and physical nature of 'pushing away'. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0797_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a distinct arm movement to signal or greet, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage. These actions are semantically unrelated and involve different body motions and intentions, with no temporal or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0798_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: adjusting clothing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a dynamic, repetitive motion typically using a broom or similar tool to clean a surface. The predicted action 'adjusting clothing' is a completely different, unrelated activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. It does not represent a plausible phase or variant of sweeping, nor is it a specific instance of an abstract category that includes sweeping. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect and receives a low score."
videos/session_0799_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves rhythmic hand movements, while the predicted action 'Eating' is a completely different activity involving food consumption. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0800_slide.mp4,slide,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' involves a distinct, dynamic motion typically characterized by smooth horizontal movement (e.g., sliding on a surface or down a slide). The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different upper-body gesture with no meaningful overlap in motion pattern, intent, or context. There is no temporal or semantic relationship between sliding and waving, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0801_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no clear temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0802_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: adjusting pants,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a dynamic, evasive movement, typically involving quick lateral or directional shifts. The predicted action 'adjusting pants' is a static, self-grooming behavior with no relation to evasion or rapid motion. This is a completely different and unrelated activity, falling into the low-score category."
videos/session_0803_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Dancing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including approach, swing, and release of a ball toward pins. 'Dancing' is a completely different activity with distinct motion patterns and intent. There is no significant semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0804_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is a specific upper-body movement, while the predicted action 'Drinking' involves a different motion typically associated with bringing an object to the mouth. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify a match under the given criteria."
videos/session_0805_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Adjusting sunglasses,0.1,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'Adjusting sunglasses' describes a completely different and unrelated gesture. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, and 'adjusting sunglasses' does not plausibly constitute a form of 'tap'."
videos/session_0806_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0807_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, pointing lacks the specific spatial trajectory required for drawing a triangle, making it only loosely related and insufficiently aligned with the intended action."
videos/session_0808_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: wiping face,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, reflexive action involving the face and respiratory system. The predicted action 'wiping face' is a distinct voluntary behavior that may sometimes follow a sneeze but is not a necessary or defining part of it. Given the specificity of 'sneeze' as a label, 'wiping face' constitutes a different action rather than a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0809_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, short-duration respiratory reflex, while the predicted action 'smoking' is a completely different behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion but not inherently related to coughing. Although both may involve the upper body or mouth area, they are semantically and functionally distinct actions with no temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0810_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the predicted action 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the key characteristic of instability inherent to 'staggering'. The prediction is related but misses the defining semantic nuance, placing it in the low-to-mid range; however, given the distinct nature of stagger vs. regular walking, it leans toward a low score."
videos/session_0811_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouthed inhalation often associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different behavior involving consuming a liquid. These actions are visually and semantically distinct, even in low-resolution thermal video, and there is no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them related."
videos/session_0812_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct and specific upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'drinking' involves bringing a container to the mouth and consuming liquid—these actions are anatomically and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between blowing one's nose and drinking, even considering partial or abstract interpretations."
videos/session_0813_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Dancing,0.6,"While 'dancing' is a dynamic and active movement, it is not semantically equivalent to 'stretchoneself'. However, both involve intentional body movement and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the stretching involves fluid or rhythmic motions. Thus, the prediction is related but less specific, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0814_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their own face, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid. These are distinct actions with different hand trajectories and object interactions. Although both may involve hand-to-head motion, drinking typically targets the mouth with an object, whereas touchface is direct skin contact without an object. Given the lack of semantic or temporal overlap, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0815_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: passing an object,0.3,"While both 'handshake' and 'passing an object' involve interpersonal interaction and hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. A handshake is a specific social gesture involving mutual grasping and shaking of hands, whereas passing an object implies transfer of an item from one person to another. The prediction is not a temporal part, synonym, or valid instance of 'handshake', but it is loosely related, warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0816_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0817_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: shoulder tap,0.6,"The predicted action 'shoulder tap' involves a light physical interaction that may resemble a gentle push, but it is generally less forceful and more deliberate than 'pushsomeone'. While both involve interpersonal contact and upper-body motion, 'shoulder tap' is a specific, milder gesture and not a clear semantic or temporal match for the more aggressive or assertive connotation of 'pushsomeone'. This falls into the medium score range due to partial relatedness but lack of equivalence in intent or intensity."
videos/session_0818_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kick,1.0,"The prediction 'kick' is a direct and semantically equivalent match to the ground truth action 'kicksomeone', as it captures the core action of kicking, which is the defining element of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0819_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinctly different gesture—non-aggressive, communicative, and lacking the forceful extension or contact associated with punching. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally dissimilar, falling into the 'completely different action' category."
videos/session_0820_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies social interaction, typically involving people facing each other and possibly standing or sitting still while talking. 'Walking' is a locomotive activity that generally does not involve conversational engagement unless explicitly shown with interacting individuals. Given the lack of indication that the walking involves conversation (e.g., walking while talking), the predicted action is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0821_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym setting, but it is less specific and somewhat generic compared to typical gym-related actions like weightlifting or using equipment. It falls into a related but not strongly representative category, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0822_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: raising arm,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any self-chosen action. The prediction 'raising arm' is a specific, valid voluntary movement consistent with the freestyle label, and thus correctly captures an instance of unconstrained activity."
videos/session_0823_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym setting, but it is less specific and not strongly indicative of typical gym-related actions like weightlifting or intense training.

videos/session_0841_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending down,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending down' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward or downward at the waist. This is a semantically equivalent and temporally valid interpretation of the action."
videos/session_0842_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short and low-resolution ones, distinguishing between lying down and sleeping can be challenging, and lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping. Thus, it qualifies as a correct temporal or postural part of the action."
videos/session_0843_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Running,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement typically involving the whole body, while the predicted action 'Running' is a completely different locomotive activity with distinct biomechanics and intent. Although both are dynamic, they are semantically and functionally unrelated in the context of human activity recognition."
videos/session_0844_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are related locomotive activities that share visual similarities, especially in low-resolution thermal video where gait speed may be hard to distinguish. However, they are not semantically equivalent nor is walking a necessary temporal part of jogging. The prediction is plausible but less specific and slightly inaccurate for the ground truth 'jog'."
videos/session_0845_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sitting,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden loss of balance and collapse to the ground, which is fundamentally different from 'sitting', a controlled and stable posture. While both may end with a person on the ground, the dynamics, intent, and motion patterns are distinct. 'Sitting' is not a temporal phase of 'falldown', nor are they semantically equivalent or contextually related under the given constraints."
videos/session_0846_jump.mp4,jump,Action: jumping rope,1.0,"The prediction 'jumping rope' is a specific instance of the ground truth action 'jump', which involves repetitive jumping motions. Since 'jump' is a high-level category and 'jumping rope' is a semantically valid and more specific form of jumping, the prediction is correct."

videos/session_0859_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: plank,0.6,"Both 'pushup' and 'plank' are upper-body calisthenic exercises performed in a prone position with hands on the ground. While not the same movement—pushups involve dynamic up-and-down motion while planks are static holds—they are closely related in form and context. Given the abstract nature of exercise labels and potential ambiguity in low-resolution thermal video, this prediction is reasonably aligned but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."

videos/session_0863_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Head turning,0.9,"The predicted action 'Head turning' is semantically very close to the ground truth 'shakehead'. Both involve deliberate horizontal movement of the head, and in many contexts (especially in low-resolution thermal video), these terms can describe the same observable motion. The slight difference in phrasing does not indicate a meaningful discrepancy in the underlying action."
videos/session_0864_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'answerphone' involves interacting with a phone, typically holding it to the ear or using it in communication.
