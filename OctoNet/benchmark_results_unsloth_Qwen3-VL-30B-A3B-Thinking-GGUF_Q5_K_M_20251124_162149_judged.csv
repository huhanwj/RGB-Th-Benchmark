videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: squat,0.6,"While 'squat' is not an exact match for 'sit', it is a related lower-body action that involves bending at the knees and hips, which can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video. However, squatting is typically more dynamic and upright than sitting, so it is not a direct temporal phase of sitting (like 'sitting down' or 'standing up'). Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap but not full equivalence."
videos/session_0002_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending over' is a close semantic and physical approximation of the ground truth 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist. Given the low-resolution thermal video context and the high-level nature of the label, this constitutes a valid interpretation of the action."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a highly plausible and semantically appropriate posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verb match, lying down is a core component of sleeping behavior, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited."
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: scratching head,0.0,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic full-body movement, while the predicted action 'scratching head' is a small, static, and unrelated gesture. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: fall,1.0,"The prediction 'fall' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', as both describe the same core event of a person losing balance and collapsing downward."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'throwing' involves primarily upper-body motion and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between jumping and throwing, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jumping jack,1.0,"The prediction 'jumping jack' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumpingjack', differing only in formatting (space vs. no space). This is a correct and precise identification of the activity."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: crouching,0.9,"The predicted action 'crouching' is a strong semantic equivalent to the ground truth 'squat', as both describe a similar body posture involving bending the knees and lowering the body. While not an exact lexical match, they are functionally and visually nearly identical in the context of human activity recognition, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine distinctions may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, which is distinct from 'walking'. While both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static, exertive nature of a lunge and instead describes a different, unrelated locomotive activity."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The prediction 'turning' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'turn', representing the same activity with only minor phrasing difference."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending forward,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending forward' is a plausible component of performing a pushup, as pushups involve forward bending of the body during the lowering phase. However, 'bending forward' alone is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., touching toes, leaning), so it doesn't fully capture the distinct, repetitive up-and-down motion characteristic of a pushup. Thus, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible scenario where walking would be considered a valid part or equivalent of a legraise."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The prediction 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'boxing', as punching or throwing punches is fundamental to boxing. While not an exact label match, it accurately captures the specific dynamic motion involved in the activity."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, and 'Standing' fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of 'shakehead'."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: phone call,1.0,"The prediction 'phone call' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of engaging in a telephone conversation."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drinking,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not temporally or semantically encompass 'drinking' as a valid part or equivalent. Thus, the prediction is related but incorrect for this specific label."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Hand to face,0.9,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves bringing the hand to the face to wipe it. The prediction 'Hand to face' accurately describes this core motion, even if it doesn't specify the wiping intent. Given the thermal, low-resolution nature of the video and the focus on observable motion rather than intent, this is a semantically equivalent and temporally valid description."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending over' is a key and characteristic component of the 'pickup' action, as picking something up typically involves bending at the waist or knees. This is a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible part of the ground truth activity."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a specific, dynamic activity involving rhythmic jumping, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes a completely different locomotive behavior with distinct motion patterns. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between walking and jump roping, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements (e.g., pushing or dragging a tool across the floor). While not identical, they are closely related in context and intent, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained tool distinction may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is considered highly accurate."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: making a phone call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming behavior near the head with hand/arm movements, while the predicted action 'making a phone call' implies holding a device to the ear. These are semantically and physically distinct actions with minimal overlap in motion or intent, especially in thermal video where object details (like a phone) are not visible. There is no temporal or contextual relationship that would make one a valid part of the other."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the arm and finger in a static or gestural manner, which is anatomically and functionally distinct from a bicep curl. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Eating' is a fundamentally different activity involving ingestion of food, often with distinct hand-to-mouth motions and jaw movement. While both may involve hand-to-face actions in thermal video, they are semantically and functionally unrelated, and neither is a temporal phase nor a valid instance of the other."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: using device,1.0,"The ground truth action 'type' implies interacting with a device such as a keyboard or touchscreen. The prediction 'using device' is a semantically equivalent and appropriate description of this activity, especially given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video where fine-grained actions like typing may not be distinguishable from general device usage."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Giving a thumbs-up,1.0,The prediction 'Giving a thumbs-up' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'thumbup'.
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct intent and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Raising hand with two fingers extended,0.3,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture (typically a circle with thumb and index finger, other fingers extended). The prediction 'Raising hand with two fingers extended' describes a different hand gesture (resembling a 'V' or peace sign), which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of making the 'OK' sign. While both involve hand gestures, the specific configuration is incorrect, leading to a low score."
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: making peace sign,0.9,"The predicted action 'making peace sign' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly used interchangeably in casual contexts."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: arm raising,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion in a clockwise direction. The prediction 'arm raising' describes a different, linear upward movement that does not capture the essential circular trajectory. While both involve arm motion, the actions are functionally distinct and not temporally or semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'Raising arm' describes a generic upward movement that does not capture the circular or directional nature of the intended action. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action lacks the key characteristics (circular path, counterclockwise direction) and is too generic to be considered a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: taking a selfie,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is interacting with or holding a stop sign, likely in a traffic or safety-related context. The predicted action 'taking a selfie' is entirely unrelated and does not represent a temporal phase, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of 'stopsign'. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion involving pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a distinctly different hand gesture that involves extending the finger outward, which is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of pulling the hand in. The actions are functionally and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or defensive motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a friendly or communicative gesture. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion dynamics differ significantly, making this a mismatch rather than a temporal or semantic variant."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct upper-body gesture with no meaningful overlap in motion semantics or context. The two actions are unrelated and do not represent temporal parts or variants of each other."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve drawing or producing a zigzag shape. While both may involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a dynamic, evasive movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture. Standing is not a temporal part of dodging, nor is it semantically related or a plausible component of the action. This constitutes a clear mismatch, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Bending forward,0.6,"Bending forward is a plausible component of the bowling action (e.g., during the approach or release phase), but it is not specific enough to fully capture the distinct activity of bowling. While related, it lacks key elements like arm motion or ball release, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Reaching up,0.9,"The ground truth action 'liftupahand' (interpreted as lifting or raising a hand) is semantically very close to the predicted action 'Reaching up', which typically involves extending an arm upward and is a plausible interpretation of the same motion in a thermal video. The actions share the same intent and directionality, making this a strong semantic match."
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: arm raise,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand), while the predicted action 'arm raise' describes a distinct, larger movement that does not involve tapping. Although both involve arm motion, they are semantically and functionally different actions with no clear temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is minimal overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0048_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion to trace or form a triangle shape, likely involving precise arm movements. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangular shape. While both may involve arm movement, pointing is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of drawing a triangle, nor is it a plausible component of that specific action. Therefore, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0049_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: coughing,0.7,"Coughing and sneezing are distinct actions, but they are closely related respiratory reflexes that may appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially in terms of sudden upper-body motion. While not semantically equivalent, the prediction shows reasonable similarity given the constraints of the input modality."
videos/session_0050_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory reflex, while the predicted action 'smoking' is a distinct and unrelated behavior. Although both may involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are semantically and functionally different actions with no temporal or categorical overlap. This constitutes a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the key characteristic of instability inherent to 'stagger'. Therefore, the actions are related but semantically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves opening the mouth wide due to tiredness or boredom, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different behavior with distinct motion patterns and intent.

videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is visually and semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Raising both arms above the head,0.9,"The predicted action 'Raising both arms above the head' is a specific and plausible instance of the ground truth action 'stretchoneself', as raising arms overhead is a common stretching movement. The prediction captures a semantically valid and temporally coherent part of the stretching activity."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: talking on a phone,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'talking on a phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or face but not necessarily touching the face itself. Although there may be slight spatial overlap (e.g., phone near face), the actions are semantically distinct and serve different purposes. This constitutes a largely incorrect prediction with minimal overlap in intent or motion."

videos/session_0057_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: handshake,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful, directional physical interaction, while the predicted action 'handshake' describes a consensual, cooperative gesture. These actions differ significantly in intent, dynamics, and physical manifestation, making them semantically and behaviorally distinct."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: stepping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies an aggressive, dynamic motion involving a kick directed at another person. The prediction 'stepping' describes a generic, non-aggressive locomotive action that does not capture the intent, directionality, or force of kicking someone. While both involve leg movement, 'stepping' is too dissimilar in semantics and intent to be considered a valid temporal part or equivalent of 'kicksomeone'."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: arms extended,0.3,"The ground truth 'punchsomeone' implies a specific, dynamic aggressive action involving striking with a fist. The prediction 'arms extended' is overly generic and static—it could describe many non-aggressive or neutral postures (e.g., reaching, stretching, or even defensive stances) and does not clearly convey the intent or motion of punching. While arm extension may occur during a punch, it lacks the specificity and dynamism required to be considered a correct or semantically equivalent description of the action."

videos/session_0064_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'Bending' accurately captures the core physical motion involved in bowing, even if it lacks the specific contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid interpretation."
videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying on the ground,0.9,"The prediction 'lying on the ground' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action of sleeping in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Jumping,0.6,"While 'jumping' is not synonymous with 'dance', it is a dynamic, rhythmic movement that could plausibly occur as part of a dance sequence, especially in freestyle or energetic dancing. However, without more context confirming the presence of other dance-like motions, the match is only partially aligned—hence a medium score."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking in place,0.9,"The predicted action 'walking in place' is a form of low-intensity jogging or closely related locomotion activity. While not an exact match, it is semantically and kinematically similar to 'jog'—both involve rhythmic leg movement and are dynamic, upright activities. Given the constraints of thermal video and potential ambiguity in motion intensity, this prediction is a reasonable interpretation of the ground truth."

videos/session_0073_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not inherently involve turning, nor is it a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending over,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending over' is related to 'pushup' as a pushup involves bending the body downward, but it is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., picking something up). It captures part of the motion but lacks the full context of a pushup (e.g., plank position, arm movement), placing it in the medium score range."

videos/session_0082_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: cover face,0.6,"The predicted action 'cover face' is related to 'wipeface' as both involve hand-to-face contact, but they are not semantically equivalent. Wiping the face implies a cleaning or wiping motion, while covering the face suggests shielding or hiding. The actions share spatial proximity but differ in intent and motion pattern, placing this in the medium-similarity range."
videos/session_0083_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending over' is a key and characteristic component of the 'pickup' action, as picking something up typically involves bending at the waist or knees. This is a logical temporal and postural part of the ground truth activity, making it semantically aligned."
videos/session_0084_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jumping jacks,0.3,"While both 'jumprope' and 'jumping jacks' involve jumping and are dynamic exercises, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping jacks do not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of jumprope, nor is one a valid instantiation of the other. Therefore, the prediction is related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0085_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Bending,0.6,"Bending is a common and plausible component of mopping the floor, as the action often involves bending forward or down to reach the floor. However, 'bending' alone is less specific and could describe many other activities (e.g., picking something up, stretching). While related and contextually reasonable, it lacks the specificity to fully capture the 'moppingfloor' activity, placing it in the medium score range."

While sitting may be the physical state during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual task being performed, especially since 'type' is not an abstract or high-level category like 'gym' but a specific action. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect."

The prediction 'Waving' describes a different hand motion involving movement, not the formation of the 'OK' sign. These actions are semantically distinct and not temporally or categorically related."
videos/session_0094_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' refers to a specific hand gesture (typically raising the hand with index and middle fingers extended in a V shape). The prediction 'Waving' describes a different hand motion involving repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down movement. While both involve hand gestures, they are semantically and visually distinct actions with different intents, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0095_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Arm raise,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'Arm raise' describes a different movement—lifting the arm vertically—which does not capture the circular trajectory or intent of drawing a circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0096_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, deliberate circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. While both may involve arm movement, pointing lacks the rotational trajectory essential to drawing a circle, making it a largely incorrect interpretation of the activity."
videos/session_0097_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Taking a selfie,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a traffic or safety-related context. The predicted action 'Taking a selfie' is entirely unrelated and does not represent a temporal phase, semantic equivalent, or plausible interpretation of 'stopsign'. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0098_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving arm,0.6,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a deliberate inward pulling motion of the hand, possibly toward the body. The prediction 'Waving arm' involves arm movement but typically implies an outward, repetitive motion (e.g., greeting), which is related in that it involves arm/hand motion but differs in direction and intent. This is a plausible but ambiguous interpretation, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0099_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension and direction indication, with no inherent pushing or repelling motion. The two actions differ significantly in intent, motion dynamics, and physical interaction, making this a mismatch."
videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a clear, dynamic arm movement with an open hand, typically for greeting or signaling. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinct gesture that usually involves extending a finger and is semantically different from waving. While both involve arm/hand motion, they serve different communicative purposes and are not temporal parts or equivalents of each other."
videos/session_0101_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: waving,0.3,"While both 'clap' and 'waving' involve hand movements, they are distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Clapping involves hands moving toward each other to produce sound, whereas waving is a side-to-side or up-and-down motion typically used for greeting. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of clapping, nor is it a plausible ambiguous interpretation under the given constraints."
videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: pointing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic movement involving gliding or moving smoothly along a surface, while the predicted action 'pointing' is a static gesture with no semantic or temporal relation to sliding. The two actions are completely different in nature and intent."
videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not involve the repetitive, angular motion characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand use, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position such as leaning, sidestepping, or turning. The prediction 'turning' is a related motion that could plausibly be part of a dodging action, especially in a low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details may be ambiguous. However, 'turning' alone is less specific and could occur in many non-dodging contexts, so it does not fully capture the intent or dynamics of 'dodge'. This warrants a medium score."
videos/session_0106_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Jump,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including approach, arm swing, and ball release, typically performed while standing or taking a few steps. 'Jump' is not a typical or logical temporal part of bowling and represents a fundamentally different physical action. There is minimal semantic or functional overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0107_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: waving,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this prediction captures the essential motion and intent of the action."
videos/session_0108_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a distinct, broader arm motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

There is no plausible interpretation under which drinking constitutes drawing a triangle or a phase thereof."
videos/session_0111_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: sneezing,1.0,"The prediction 'sneezing' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'sneeze', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0112_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'smoking' is a deliberate, sustained behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion. Although both may involve the mouth and upper body, they are semantically and functionally distinct with no temporal or categorical overlap. Smoking does not constitute a part of coughing, nor is it a plausible interpretation of the same thermal activity."
videos/session_0113_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: bending down,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often associated with imbalance or difficulty. The prediction 'bending down' describes a controlled, deliberate motion that is not temporally or semantically aligned with staggering.

videos/session_0115_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and motion patterns. Blowing one's nose typically involves hand-to-face contact and a forward lean, whereas coughing is a reflexive expulsion of air without necessarily involving the hands. Given the specificity of the ground truth label and the lack of clear overlap in action semantics or temporal phases, the prediction is considered related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0116_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' involves extending or reaching limbs to stretch the body, which is a controlled, often static or slow dynamic movement. The predicted action 'throwing' implies a rapid, forceful motion typically involving propulsion of an object, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from stretching. There is no significant overlap in intent, motion pattern, or context between the two actions."
videos/session_0117_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'drinking' typically involves holding a container near the mouth but not necessarily touching the face in the same manner. These are semantically distinct actions with minimal overlap in intent or motion pattern, especially in a thermal video context where fine details are limited. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0119_hug.mp4,hug,Action: handshake,0.2,"The ground truth action 'hug' involves close physical contact with arms wrapped around another person, while 'handshake' is a distinct social gesture involving a brief grasp of hands. Although both are interpersonal interactions, they are semantically and physically different actions with little overlap in motion or intent. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0120_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: handshake,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful, directional physical interaction, while the predicted action 'handshake' describes a consensual, cooperative social gesture.

videos/session_0126_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending forward,0.9,"The prediction 'Bending forward' is a core component of the action 'bow', which typically involves bending the torso forward as a gesture of respect or greeting. This is a semantically equivalent and temporally valid representation of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0127_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and 'lying down' is a core and necessary component of sleeping. While not an exact synonym, it is a highly accurate semantic proxy in the context of human activity recognition from thermal video, where fine-grained states like 'asleep' vs. 'lying awake' may be indistinguishable. Thus, the prediction is considered correct with high confidence."
videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Raise arms,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Raise arms' is a plausible component of dancing and reflects an active motion consistent with dance, but it is overly specific and does not fully capture the broader, rhythmic, or expressive nature typically associated with dancing. Thus, it falls into the medium score range as a related but less specific prediction."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jumping,0.3,"While both 'jog' and 'jumping' are dynamic activities, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jogging involves continuous forward locomotion with rhythmic steps, whereas jumping is a vertical or explosive motion without inherent forward progression. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase of jogging nor is it semantically equivalent, placing it in the low-score range."

videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a dynamic, full-body exercise involving repeated jumping with arm and leg movements. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static, inactive posture that does not correspond to any temporal phase of performing jumping jacks. This is a generic static label applied to a clearly dynamic activity, which falls under the low-score category per the evaluation criteria."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'squat' is a dynamic, lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically from a standing position down toward a seated posture. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static upright posture with no movement, which does not represent a squat nor any logical temporal phase of it (e.g., lowering down or rising up from a squat). Given that 'squat' is a specific, active motion and the prediction is a generic static state, this constitutes a significant mismatch."
videos/session_0134_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, which is distinctly different from 'walking'. While both involve leg movement, walking is a continuous gait pattern and not a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of a lunge. The prediction fails to capture the static, exertive, and unilateral nature of a lunge, making it a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0135_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

Although both involve being low to the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. Crawling is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of a pushup, nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract labeling. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0137_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Jumping,0.1,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise where a person raises their legs while lying down or seated, typically involving controlled lower-body movement. The predicted action 'Jumping' is a completely different dynamic activity involving both legs propelling the body off the ground. These actions differ significantly in motion pattern, muscle engagement, and intent, making them semantically unrelated."

videos/session_0147_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar postures, motions, and intent. While not identical, they are closely related enough in context and execution to be considered a high-confidence match, especially given the low-resolution thermal video input which may obscure fine-grained details like the presence of liquid or specific tool type."
videos/session_0148_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: head touch,0.6,"The predicted action 'head touch' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks specificity and does not fully capture the grooming nature of brushing hair.

The prediction 'Raise arm' describes a gross motor movement that does not capture the fine hand gesture required. While raising an arm might occur during the process of making the sign, it is not a sufficient or characteristic part of the action, making the prediction only loosely related at best."

While 'raising arm' is part of this gesture, it is overly generic and misses the specific intent of signaling 'stop'. However, given the thermal, low-resolution context, partial credit is given for capturing a key motion component, but not enough to be considered semantically equivalent or a logical temporal phase."
videos/session_0160_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture.

videos/session_0173_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'eating' involves deliberate hand-to-mouth movements and chewing. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0174_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture unrelated to coughing. Standing does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of coughing, nor is it a plausible component of the action. This constitutes a completely different and incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0175_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical nuance of instability inherent to 'stagger'. This is not a temporal part nor a semantic equivalent, but a related yet significantly different action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0176_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: scratching head,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves opening the mouth wide and inhaling deeply, typically associated with tiredness. The predicted action 'scratching head' is a completely different behavior involving hand-to-head contact and has no semantic or temporal relationship to yawning. There is no overlap in motion, intent, or body parts involved."
videos/session_0177_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a person using a tissue or hand to clear their nose, which is a distinct and specific upper-body gesture. The predicted action 'Eating' involves bringing food to the mouth and is unrelated in both motion and intent. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between these actions."
videos/session_0178_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: raise arms overhead,0.9,"Raising arms overhead is a common and specific movement within the broader category of 'stretchoneself'. It aligns well with the intent and typical execution of stretching, making it a semantically appropriate and valid instance of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0179_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: eating,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their face, which is distinct from 'eating'. While both may involve hand-to-face motion, eating typically includes mouth-related actions like chewing or holding food, which are not implied by 'touchface'. The actions are semantically different and not temporally or categorically related under the given constraints."

videos/session_0182_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a clear physical interaction involving forceful contact or movement toward another person. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a gestural, non-contact behavior that does not involve pushing or any form of physical interaction. These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify a higher score."

videos/session_0184_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: handshake,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' involves aggressive physical contact, while the predicted action 'handshake' is a friendly, non-aggressive social gesture. These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them equivalent or related."
videos/session_0185_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies social interaction, which may involve standing but is not synonymous with it. 'Standing' is a generic static posture and does not capture the interactive or communicative nature of 'conversation'. While standing could occur during a conversation, the prediction lacks any indication of interaction, making it insufficiently specific and only weakly related."
videos/session_0186_sit.mp4,sit,Action: squat,0.6,"While 'squat' is not an exact match for 'sit', it is a related lower-body action that involves bending at the knees and hips, which can appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video. However, squatting is typically more dynamic and upright than sitting, so it is not a direct temporal phase of sitting (like 'sitting down' or 'standing up'). Thus, it falls into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap but not full equivalence."
videos/session_0187_walk.mp4,walk,Action: walking,1.0,The predicted action 'walking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'walk'.
videos/session_0188_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending down,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist, which is closely aligned with the predicted action 'bending down'. While not an exact lexical match, the two describe highly similar physical motions in this context, especially given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video where fine distinctions may be ambiguous. Thus, the prediction is semantically and kinematically appropriate."
videos/session_0189_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying on the ground,0.9,"The prediction 'lying on the ground' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verb match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action of sleeping in a thermal video context."
videos/session_0190_dance.mp4,dance,Action: punch,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a rhythmic, expressive, or coordinated full-body movement typically performed to music. The predicted action 'punch' is a specific, aggressive upper-body motion that is not characteristic of dancing and does not fall under a plausible temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'dance'. While both are dynamic actions, they belong to fundamentally different activity categories."
videos/session_0191_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a clear temporal part of the other. While both involve forward motion on foot, jogging implies a faster pace and higher intensity than walking. Given the similarity in motion type but difference in intensity, this falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0192_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: fall,1.0,"The prediction 'fall' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', as both describe the same core event of a person losing balance and collapsing downward."
videos/session_0193_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Punching,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'punching' is an upper-body striking motion. These actions are fundamentally different in both intent and biomechanics, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0194_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a specific dynamic exercise involving repeated jumping with arm and leg movements. The prediction 'Jumping' captures the core motion of the activity, as jumping jacks inherently involve jumping. While not an exact label match, it is a semantically close and valid representation of the primary movement, warranting a high score."

videos/session_0197_turn.mp4,turn,Action: shuffling,0.3,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while 'shuffling' typically refers to small, sliding steps without significant rotation. Although both involve movement, they describe distinct types of motion with little semantic overlap. 'Shuffling' is not a temporal part nor a specific instance of 'turning', leading to a low score."
videos/session_0198_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending down,0.6,"The predicted action 'bending down' is related to 'pushup' as it describes a component motion (lowering the body), but it lacks specificity and could describe many other actions (e.g., picking something up). It is not an exact match nor a clear temporal phase unique to pushups, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0199_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Kicking,0.6,"While 'kicking' and 'legraise' both involve leg movement, they are distinct actions with different intent and form. A legraise typically involves lifting the leg while lying down or seated, often as a controlled exercise, whereas kicking implies a dynamic, propulsive motion. However, in low-resolution thermal video, these may appear visually similar, and both fall under lower-body exercises, warranting partial credit."
videos/session_0200_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' refers to mimicking drumming motions, typically involving rhythmic arm movements. The predicted action 'Drinking' involves a completely different set of motions (e.g., bringing a container to the mouth) and is semantically unrelated. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0201_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: pointing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, aggressive upper-body movements such as punching and defensive maneuvers. The predicted action 'pointing' is a static or minimally dynamic gesture that does not align with the core motion patterns of boxing, nor is it a plausible temporal phase (e.g., winding up for a punch) or a related high-level category. It represents a fundamentally different activity."
videos/session_0202_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing still,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a clear, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing still' describes a static posture with no indication of head motion. This is a completely different action and fails to capture the essential dynamic nature of the labeled activity."
videos/session_0203_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: talking on a mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'talking on a mobile phone' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'answerphone', as both describe the same core activity of using a phone for conversation."

videos/session_0209_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: golf swing,0.0,"The predicted action 'golf swing' is completely unrelated to the ground truth action 'moppingfloor'. Mopping involves repetitive sweeping motions with a mop, typically close to the ground and using both hands, while a golf swing is a distinct, sport-specific motion involving a club and a very different posture and movement pattern. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0210_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Arms raised above head,0.3,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' typically involves hand movements near the head, possibly with a brushing motion. The prediction 'Arms raised above head' is a generic static pose that does not specifically indicate hair brushing. While arms raised could be part of the motion (e.g., lifting hair), it lacks the specificity or contextual cues to confidently infer brushing. Thus, it is only weakly related and falls into the low-score range."
videos/session_0211_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: raise arm,0.9,"The predicted action 'raise arm' is a core component of performing a bicep curl, which primarily involves flexing the elbow and lifting the forearm (often perceived as raising the arm in low-resolution thermal video).

videos/session_0213_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'Drinking' implies a different interaction (e.g., holding a cup, tilting head back) and is semantically distinct. While both may involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are functionally and contextually different activities with little overlap in intent or execution. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0214_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which involves fine hand/finger movements and is typically performed while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes only the posture, not the actual activity. Since 'sitting' is a generic static state and does not capture the essential action of typing, it is considered a completely different activity in the context of HAR, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0215_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in phrasing (pluralization and spacing), which does not affect the meaning."
videos/session_0216_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct intent and form. Although both involve hand movements, they are semantically and functionally distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0217_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which is a specific static or near-static hand configuration. The predicted action 'waving' involves a distinctly different hand motion (repetitive movement of the hand back and forth). These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor part of the same broader category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0218_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: hand raised,0.9,"The ground truth action 'makevictorysign' involves raising a hand in a specific gesture (typically a V-sign). The prediction 'hand raised' captures the essential motion and posture of the action, even if it lacks the precise detail of the gesture. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the focus on action similarity rather than exact wording, this is a semantically close and valid interpretation."
videos/session_0219_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a clockwise direction. The predicted action 'waving' is a different type of arm movement—typically a back-and-forth or up-and-down motion—and does not resemble the circular trajectory required by the ground truth. The actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0220_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically side-to-side or up-and-down repetitive hand motion that does not match the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a counterclockwise circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0221_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' refers to a person mimicking or holding a stop sign gesture (typically an outstretched arm with an open palm), which is a specific static or posed action. The predicted action 'waving' involves a different hand/arm motion (typically repetitive side-to-side or up-and-down movement) and is semantically distinct from the stop sign gesture. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0222_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Arm raise,0.6,"The ground truth 'pullhandin' suggests a specific arm movement where the hand is pulled inward toward the body, possibly involving elbow flexion or retraction. The prediction 'Arm raise' describes a different motion—lifting the arm upward—which is related in that it involves arm movement but does not align with the direction or intent of 'pulling in.' This is a plausible but imprecise interpretation, falling into the medium score range due to partial semantic overlap but clear kinematic difference."
videos/session_0223_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'Pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension to indicate direction or object, lacking the defensive or repulsive intent and motion of 'pushhandaway'. The two actions differ significantly in intent, motion dynamics, and semantic meaning, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0224_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: arm lift,0.9,"The predicted action 'arm lift' is a core component of 'handwave', as waving typically involves lifting and moving the arm. While not an exact lexical match, it captures the essential motion and intent of the ground truth action."

videos/session_0227_slide.mp4,slide,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic motion involving movement along a surface (e.g., sliding down a slide or sliding on the floor), while the predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0228_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific hand or arm movement creating a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control. 'Pointing' is a different gesture with a distinct intent and motion pattern, lacking the lateral or oscillatory movement characteristic of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand use, they are semantically and kinematically dissimilar, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0229_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden shifts in body position. 'Walking' is a slow, steady, and non-evasive gait that does not align with the intent or dynamics of dodging. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0230_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: bending,0.6,"Bending is a common component of the bowling action (e.g., during the approach or release), but it is not specific enough to fully capture the distinct activity of bowling. While related and plausible, it lacks the contextual elements (e.g., arm swing, ball release) that define bowling, placing it in the medium score range."

videos/session_0232_tap.mp4,tap,Action: scratching head,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a light, brief contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'scratching head' involves a different motion and intent. Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different purposes and patterns, making this a mismatch."
videos/session_0233_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is minimal overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0234_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: arm raise,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific upper-body motion where the person traces a triangular shape, likely with their arm or hand. The prediction 'arm raise' describes a generic upward movement of the arm, which may be part of drawing a triangle but is not sufficiently specific or semantically equivalent. While both involve arm motion, 'arm raise' lacks the distinctive pattern and intent of 'drawtriangle', making it only loosely related and not a valid temporal or semantic match."

The prediction 'gesturing' is a vague and significantly less intense action that does not convey the forceful or combative nature of punching. While both involve arm movement, gesturing is too generic and semantically distant from the intent and mechanics of punching, falling into the low-score category."
videos/session_0247_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which often involves gestures, facial expressions, or movement while talking. While 'standing' could be a posture during conversation, it is overly generic and static, failing to capture the core interactive nature of 'conversation'.

videos/session_0251_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying down' is a valid and highly indicative posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are absent. Thus, it qualifies as a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible representation of the action."
videos/session_0252_dance.mp4,dance,Action: arm raise,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Arm raise' is a plausible component of dancing and represents a specific, active motion consistent with dance-like behavior. However, it is less specific and may also occur in non-dance contexts (e.g., stretching, signaling), so it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0253_jog.mp4,jog,Action: running,1.0,"The predicted action 'running' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'jog', as both describe similar forms of fast, repetitive locomotion. In common usage and HAR contexts, 'jog' and 'run' are often used interchangeably or represent points on the same activity spectrum."

videos/session_0257_squat.mp4,squat,Action: jump,0.2,"The ground truth action 'squat' involves bending the knees and lowering the body, typically with feet flat on the ground and hips moving downward. The predicted action 'jump' is a distinctly different dynamic movement involving propelling the body upward off the ground. While both are active lower-body motions, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, or interchangeable under any abstract label. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0258_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward or backward step with knee bending, while the predicted action 'Walking' describes a different, continuous locomotive activity. Although both involve leg movement, they are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent. Walking is not a temporal phase of performing a lunge, nor is it a valid instance under an abstract label—here, 'lunge' is precise and not abstract. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0259_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walking' describes forward locomotion.

videos/session_0268_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: talking on mobile phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe or touch their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'talking on mobile phone' describes a completely different activity that typically involves holding a phone to the ear or face, not wiping the face. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, and the prediction does not represent a plausible part or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0269_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending over,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending over' is a key and characteristic component of the 'pickup' action, as picking something up typically involves bending at the waist or knees. This is a logical temporal and postural part of the ground truth activity, making it semantically equivalent in this context."

videos/session_0275_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different activity with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve bringing an object to the mouth, the context, object used, and motion dynamics are sufficiently different to consider this a mismatch."
videos/session_0276_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the act of typing on a keyboard or similar device, which involves fine hand/finger movements. The predicted action 'sitting' describes a static posture and does not capture the essential typing activity. While sitting may be the body posture during typing, it is too generic and fails to reflect the actual action being performed, especially given that 'type' is a specific, non-abstract label."
videos/session_0277_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is raised, typically as a sign of approval.

The prediction 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture involving an extended finger, which is semantically distinct and not a temporal or contextual part of making the 'OK' sign. Therefore, the actions are largely dissimilar."
videos/session_0280_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: making a peace sign,1.0,"The predicted action 'making a peace sign' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly used interchangeably in everyday contexts."

The predicted action 'pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular movement. These actions are fundamentally different in both form and intent, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0282_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: raise arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'raise arm' describes a generic upward arm movement that does not capture the circular or directional nature of the true action. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action lacks the key characteristics (circular path, counterclockwise direction) and is too generic to be considered a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0283_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or presenting a stop sign, which typically involves standing still with the sign raised. While 'raising arm' could be part of that motion, it is too generic and does not specifically indicate interaction with a stop sign. Without evidence of the sign itself or clear contextual alignment, this prediction is only weakly related and likely describes a different action altogether."
videos/session_0284_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'waving' involves a distinctly different outward, repetitive hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, nor part of the same high-level category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0286_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The prediction 'Waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."
videos/session_0287_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. Although both involve arm movement, they are semantically and functionally different actions with no significant temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0288_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Raising arm,0.3,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves bringing hands together in front of the body, typically at chest level. 'Raising arm' is a different motion that may occur during clapping but is not sufficient on its own to constitute clapping. It lacks the essential bilateral hand movement and contact characteristic of clapping, making it only loosely related and overly generic for this specific dynamic action."
videos/session_0289_slide.mp4,slide,Action: throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' involves a smooth, gliding motion typically along a surface, while the predicted action 'throwing' is a distinct upper-body motion involving propulsion of an object.

videos/session_0291_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden shifts in body position. The predicted action 'walking' describes a steady, forward locomotion and does not capture the dynamic, reactive nature of dodging. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern."
videos/session_0292_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throwing,0.9,"The predicted action 'Throwing' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bowling', as bowling involves the act of throwing a ball. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of the label, this prediction accurately captures the essential motion of the activity."
videos/session_0293_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' (interpreted as raising one hand) is semantically very close to 'pointing', as pointing typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this is a reasonable and specific interpretation of the action."
videos/session_0294_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Arm Raising,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object with a finger or hand), while the predicted action 'Arm Raising' describes a different motion that does not inherently involve tapping. Although arm raising could be part of a broader sequence that includes tapping, it is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'tap' on its own, making the prediction only loosely related at best."
videos/session_0295_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a specific hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or fine motor tasks. The predicted action 'Pointing' describes a different hand gesture where one finger (usually the index) is extended while others are curled. While both involve hand movements, they are functionally and visually distinct actions with different intent and form. Therefore, the prediction does not match the ground truth semantically, temporally, or categorically."
videos/session_0296_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion to trace or form a triangle shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'pointing' is a generic gesture that does not capture the structured, multi-directional movement required to draw a triangle. While pointing might be a component of drawing, it is insufficient and semantically distinct from the full action, making this a largely incorrect match."

videos/session_0299_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical instability inherent to 'staggering,' making it a significantly different action rather than a temporal part or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0300_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving ingestion of liquid.

The predicted action 'speaking' is a completely different activity involving mouth movement and vocalization, with no meaningful overlap or temporal relationship to blowing one's nose. There is no semantic or contextual similarity between the two actions."
videos/session_0302_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Throwing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stretchoneself' involves extending or lengthening the body or limbs, typically in a controlled and static or slow dynamic manner. The predicted action 'Throwing' is a rapid, forceful motion involving propulsion of an object, which is fundamentally different in intent, motion pattern, and biomechanics. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0303_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a person making contact with their face, which is distinct from 'smoking'. While both may involve hand-to-face motion, smoking implies a specific behavior (inhaling smoke from a cigarette) that is not semantically equivalent or a temporal phase of touching one's face. The actions are functionally and contextually different, warranting a low score."

videos/session_0305_hug.mp4,hug,Action: push,0.1,"The ground truth action 'hug' involves close physical contact and affectionate embracing, whereas the predicted action 'push' implies forceful separation or repulsion. These actions are semantically and physically opposite in intent and motion, indicating a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0306_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Punching,0.6,"While 'punching' and 'pushsomeone' are both aggressive or forceful interpersonal actions, they are distinct in intent and motion: punching involves a closed fist striking, whereas pushing typically uses open hands to exert force. However, in low-resolution thermal video, these actions may appear visually similar, and both fall under the broader category of physical contact or assaultive behavior. Thus, the prediction is related but not equivalent, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0307_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Posture adjustment,0.1,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' implies a dynamic, aggressive movement involving contact or intent to strike with the leg. The prediction 'Posture adjustment' describes a minor, non-aggressive, and typically static or subtle body repositioning, which is semantically and behaviorally inconsistent with kicking. There is no plausible temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0308_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: handshake,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' involves aggressive physical contact, while the predicted action 'handshake' is a friendly, non-violent social gesture. These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or contextual overlap that would justify considering them equivalent or related."
videos/session_0309_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies social interaction, which typically involves gestures, facing another person, or verbal exchange. While people may stand during a conversation, the prediction 'standing' is overly generic and static, failing to capture the interactive nature of the activity. Without evidence of interaction, this prediction is only weakly related."

videos/session_0312_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'bending' accurately captures the core physical motion of bowing, even if it lacks the contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity, this is a semantically appropriate match."
videos/session_0313_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical physical state associated with sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. Thus, it qualifies as a correct interpretation under temporal and contextual partiality."
videos/session_0314_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Jumping,0.6,"While 'jumping' is not an exact match for 'dance', it is a plausible and dynamic movement that could reasonably occur within a freestyle dance context, especially given the abstract nature of the label 'dance' in thermal video where fine motion details are limited. However, jumping alone is less specific to dancing compared to movements like swaying or rhythmic stepping, hence a medium score."
videos/session_0315_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a clear temporal part of the other. While both involve forward motion on foot, jogging implies a faster pace and higher intensity than walking. Given the similarity in action type but difference in intensity and category specificity, this falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0316_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Jump,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a loss of balance and uncontrolled descent to the ground, whereas the predicted action 'Jump' is an intentional, controlled upward or forward motion. These actions are physically and semantically distinct; jumping does not represent a temporal phase or variant of falling down, nor are they contextually related in a way that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0317_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Jumping jacks,1.0,"Jumping jacks involve repeated jumping motions, which are a specific and valid instance of the ground truth action 'jump'. The prediction aligns semantically and dynamically with the label."
videos/session_0318_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Throwing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jumpingjack' is a dynamic, full-body exercise involving simultaneous arm and leg movement. The predicted action 'Throwing' involves a unilateral upper-body motion and is semantically unrelated to jumping jacks. There is no temporal or categorical overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0319_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Bending Forward,0.6,"Bending forward is a motion that can occur during a squat, but it is not specific enough to fully capture the 'squat' action, which involves bending knees and lowering the hips. The prediction describes a related upper-body movement but misses the key lower-body mechanics of squatting, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0320_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Jumping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward step with one leg while lowering the hips, whereas the predicted action 'Jumping' involves both feet leaving the ground and is biomechanically distinct. Although both are dynamic activities, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or subsumed under a shared abstract category in this context. Thus, the prediction represents a different action and receives a low score."
videos/session_0321_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning around,1.0,"The prediction 'turning around' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth action 'turn', describing the same core movement with slightly more detail."
videos/session_0322_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Bending down,0.6,"The predicted action 'Bending down' is related to 'pushup' as pushups involve bending the elbows and lowering the body, which may appear as 'bending down' in a low-resolution thermal video. However, 'bending down' is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., picking something up). It captures part of the motion but lacks the full context of a pushup, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0323_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises.

videos/session_0324_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context are distinct, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0325_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'boxing' involves dynamic, repetitive punching movements typically performed in a fighting stance. The predicted action 'waving' is a completely different gesture involving arm movement for greeting or signaling, with no semantic or kinematic overlap with boxing. This constitutes a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0326_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion.

There is no plausible scenario where talking on a phone would be considered part of eating or vice versa."
videos/session_0329_drink.mp4,drink,Action: raise arm,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drink' typically involves bringing a cup or bottle to the mouth, which may include raising an arm as a component. However, 'raise arm' alone is too generic and does not sufficiently capture the specific intent or completion of the drinking action. Without clear indication of holding or consuming a beverage, the prediction lacks the necessary context to be considered a correct or temporally partial match for 'drink'."
videos/session_0330_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Touching face,0.9,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves contact with the face, and the predicted action 'Touching face' is a semantically close and plausible interpretation given the low-resolution thermal video. While not an exact match, it captures the essential interaction with the face, which is consistent with the intended activity."
videos/session_0331_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking up an object typically involves bending down. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action, even if not the full sequence."
videos/session_0332_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: arm extension,0.3,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' is a specific, dynamic activity involving coordinated full-body motion, particularly jumping and arm swinging with a rope. The prediction 'arm extension' describes only a generic upper-body movement that may occur as a minor component of many activities but does not capture the essence or primary motion of jump roping. It is too vague and incomplete to be considered a valid temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'jumprope'."

Given the context and constraints, this is a highly plausible and functionally equivalent prediction."
videos/session_0334_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (e.g., a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion usually in response to an itch. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, nor is scratching a logical temporal phase of brushing hair. Thus, the prediction is partially related but incorrect for the given ground truth."
videos/session_0335_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: adjusting mask,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific dynamic upper-body exercise, while the predicted action 'adjusting mask' describes a completely unrelated static or fine-motor activity.

The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the index finger to indicate direction or draw attention, which is a distinctly different hand gesture with different intent and form. While both involve hand movements, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or interchangeable under any reasonable interpretation of the label. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

Although both involve hand movement, they are semantically distinct gestures with different intents and visual forms. The prediction does not capture the specific nature of the victory sign and is not a temporal part or valid variant of it."
videos/session_0343_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'Raising arm' describes a generic upward movement that does not capture the circular or directional nature of the intended action.

While 'raising arm' is somewhat related, it is too generic and lacks the contextual specificity of a stop-sign gesture (e.g., palm forward, arm extended). Without clear indication of the stop-sign context, this prediction is only weakly aligned and risks being a generic motion unrelated to the intended action."

videos/session_0350_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending forward,0.9,"The prediction 'Bending forward' is a core component of the action 'bow', which typically involves bending the torso forward as a gesture of respect or greeting. This is a semantically equivalent and temporally valid representation of the ground truth action."
videos/session_0351_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a highly plausible and semantically appropriate component of the ground truth action 'sleep', as sleeping typically involves lying down. Given the constraints of thermal video and the high-level nature of the label, this constitutes a correct interpretation."
videos/session_0352_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Kick,0.6,"The ground truth 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that can include a variety of movements. 'Kick' is a specific, active motion that could plausibly occur as part of a dance sequence, especially in styles involving dynamic leg movements. However, 'kick' alone is not strongly indicative of dancing and could belong to other activities like martial arts or exercise. Thus, it is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0353_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Running,1.0,"The prediction 'Running' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'jog', as both describe similar forms of locomotion at a moderate to fast pace. In common usage and activity recognition contexts, 'jog' and 'run' are often used interchangeably or represent points on a continuum of the same activity."
videos/session_0354_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling,1.0,"The prediction 'Falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'falldown', describing the same physical event with only minor phrasing differences."
videos/session_0355_jump.mp4,jump,Action: squat,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement, while the predicted action 'squat' is a distinct lower-body exercise involving bending at the knees and hips, typically without leaving the ground. Although both involve leg movement, they are semantically and kinematically different actions with little temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0356_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jump,0.9,"The ground truth 'jumpingjack' is a specific dynamic exercise involving jumping with coordinated arm and leg movements. The prediction 'jump' captures the core dynamic component (jumping) of the action, though it omits the full-body coordination typical of jumping jacks. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the emphasis on action similarity over exactness, this is a highly plausible and semantically close match."
videos/session_0357_squat.mp4,squat,Action: jump,0.2,"The ground truth action 'squat' involves bending the knees and lowering the body, typically with feet flat on the ground and hips moving downward. The predicted action 'jump' is a distinctly different dynamic movement involving propelling the body upward off the ground. While both are lower-body actions, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related phases, nor fall under a shared abstract category that would justify a higher score. Therefore, this is considered a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0358_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward or backward step with bending knees, while the prediction 'walking' describes a different, continuous locomotive activity. Although both involve leg movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct; walking is not a temporal phase or valid variant of a lunge."
videos/session_0359_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning around,1.0,"The prediction 'turning around' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth action 'turn', as both describe the same rotational movement."
videos/session_0360_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bend over,0.6,"The predicted action 'bend over' is related to 'pushup' as bending over can be part of the motion involved in performing a pushup, but it is less specific and could describe other actions (e.g., picking something up). It captures some dynamic aspect of the activity but lacks the precision or full context of a pushup."
videos/session_0361_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'legraise' refers to a specific exercise involving lifting the legs, typically while lying down or seated. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different locomotive activity with no semantic or temporal overlap with leg raises. There is no plausible scenario where walking would be considered a valid part or equivalent of a legraise."
videos/session_0362_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, dynamic arm movements mimicking drumming, while the predicted action 'eating' is a completely unrelated activity involving hand-to-mouth motions and typically static posture. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0363_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punching,1.0,"The prediction 'Punching' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'. It is a specific and accurate representation of the activity, making it a semantic equivalent in this context."
videos/session_0364_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'shakehead' is a specific, dynamic head movement, while the prediction 'Standing' describes a static, full-body posture with no indication of head motion.

videos/session_0368_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: making a phone call,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'making a phone call' describes a completely different behavior involving holding a device to the ear or face, with no meaningful overlap in motion, intent, or visual appearance in thermal video. There is no temporal or semantic relationship between the two actions."
videos/session_0369_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pickup' typically involves bending down to retrieve an object. The predicted action 'bending' is a core and necessary component of the 'pickup' motion, making it a valid temporal and semantic part of the intended activity."
videos/session_0370_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping jacks,0.3,"While both 'jumprope' and 'jumping jacks' involve jumping and are dynamic exercises, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns. Jumping jacks do not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of jumprope, nor is one a specific instance of the other. Therefore, the prediction is related but incorrect for this specific ground truth label."
videos/session_0371_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). While not identical, they are closely related household chores often confused in low-resolution thermal video where fine details (like presence of liquid or specific tool shape) may be indistinguishable. Given the constraints of the input and the focus on action similarity over exact label match, this prediction is highly plausible."
videos/session_0372_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Adjusting headwear,0.2,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves actively grooming or brushing one's hair, while the prediction 'Adjusting headwear' refers to manipulating a hat or similar item. These are distinct actions with different intents and hand movements; adjusting headwear does not constitute a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of brushing hair."
videos/session_0373_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Hand raise,0.6,"A bicep curl involves flexing the elbow to lift a weight toward the shoulder, which may appear in thermal video as an arm or hand movement. 'Hand raise' is related but less specific—it typically implies raising the arm overhead or laterally, not the elbow-flexion motion characteristic of a bicep curl. While both involve arm movement, the predicted action does not accurately capture the specific mechanics of a bicep curl, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0374_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: covering face,0.1,"The ground truth action 'playphone' implies interacting with a mobile phone, typically involving hand movements near the face or upper body. The prediction 'covering face' describes a different action that does not involve phone usage and is not a logical temporal part or semantic equivalent of 'playphone'. While both may involve the face region, the intent and activity are distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0375_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: hand to mouth,0.9,"The prediction 'hand to mouth' accurately describes a key motion involved in brushing teeth, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine details like a toothbrush may not be visible. This is a semantically valid and temporally plausible component of the 'brushteeth' action."
videos/session_0376_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth action 'type' refers to the activity of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), which involves fine hand/finger movements and is typically performed while seated. The predicted action 'sitting' describes only the posture, not the actual activity. Since 'sitting' is a generic static state and does not capture the essential action of typing, it is considered a completely different activity in this context."
videos/session_0377_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,"The prediction 'thumbs up' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'thumbup', differing only in phrasing (plural vs. singular), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0378_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'pointing' describes a different hand gesture with a distinct purpose and form.

videos/session_0379_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'makeoksign' refers to forming the 'OK' hand gesture, which is a specific static hand pose. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different hand motion involving movement, not the formation of the 'OK' sign. These actions are semantically distinct with little overlap in intent or execution, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0380_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: peace sign,1.0,"The predicted action 'peace sign' is a semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'makevictorysign', as both refer to the same hand gesture commonly used to signify victory or peace."
videos/session_0381_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: raise arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcircleclockwise' implies a specific circular arm motion, likely in front of the body. The prediction 'raise arm' describes a generic upward movement that does not capture the circular trajectory or intent of drawing a circle. While both involve arm movement, the actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0382_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically side-to-side or up-and-down repetitive hand motion that does not match the directional and geometric specificity of drawing a counterclockwise circle. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions."
videos/session_0383_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'waving' describes a dynamic hand gesture that is semantically unrelated to presenting or holding a stop sign. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0384_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'Waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a rhythmic, communicative motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from pulling the hand in. While both involve hand movement, they serve different purposes and exhibit opposite directional tendencies, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0385_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion pattern differ significantly, making this a mismatch rather than a temporal or semantic variant."
videos/session_0386_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Saluting,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'saluting' involve arm movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. Saluting is a specific, formal gesture typically involving a rigid hand position near the forehead, whereas handwaving is a broader, often side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'saluting' is not a temporal phase nor a semantic equivalent, placing it in the low-score range."
videos/session_0387_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while 'waving' is a distinct gesture usually directed toward another person and lacks the cleaning context or motion pattern of sweeping. The two actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement."
videos/session_0388_clap.mp4,clap,Action: sneezing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'clap' involves deliberate hand movements to produce sound, while the predicted action 'sneezing' is an involuntary respiratory reflex with no semantic or temporal overlap.

videos/session_0392_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Punching,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including arm swinging and ball release, typically in a forward motion. 'Punching' is a distinctly different action involving rapid, forceful extension of the arm, usually in a combat or exercise context. The two actions are not semantically related, nor is punching a plausible temporal part or variant of bowling. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0393_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: arm raise,1.0,"The predicted action 'arm raise' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'liftupahand', as both describe the same motion of raising one or both arms."
videos/session_0394_tap.mp4,tap,Action: checking a watch,0.3,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, deliberate contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the prediction 'checking a watch' describes a different, more specific interaction. Although both could involve hand movement near the wrist, 'checking a watch' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'tap', nor is it a plausible generalization. The actions are related only loosely by context, warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0395_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: raising hand,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'raising hand' describes a gross upper-body movement that does not involve the specific finger motions implied by the ground truth. These actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no significant overlap or temporal relationship."
videos/session_0396_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Throwing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a fine motor activity, likely involving drawing or gesturing a triangular shape, possibly with hands or body. The predicted action 'Throwing' is a completely different gross motor movement with no semantic or temporal overlap.

These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0398_cough.mp4,cough,Action: smoking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'smoking' is a deliberate, sustained behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion. Although both may involve the mouth and upper body, they are semantically and functionally distinct. Smoking does not represent a temporal phase or variant of coughing, nor are they interchangeable in context. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0399_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' does not capture the distinctive instability inherent to 'staggering,' making this a semantically different action rather than a temporal part or equivalent."
videos/session_0400_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic mouth-stretching behavior typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a liquid.

videos/session_0412_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'Bending' is a core component of the ground truth action 'bow', as bowing typically involves bending forward at the waist or knees. Given the thermal, low-resolution nature of the video and the high-level label, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally plausible interpretation."
videos/session_0413_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on the ground,0.9,"The prediction 'Lying on the ground' is a strong semantic match for the ground truth 'sleep', as lying down is a typical and necessary posture for sleeping. While not an exact verbal match, it accurately reflects the physical state associated with the action in the context of thermal video where fine details like closed eyes aren't visible."
videos/session_0414_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Jumping,0.9,"The ground truth action 'dance' is an abstract, dynamic label that encompasses a variety of movements. 'Jumping' is a plausible and specific movement that could reasonably occur as part of dancing, especially in freestyle or energetic dance styles. Therefore, the prediction aligns well with the intended activity."
videos/session_0415_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a clear temporal part of the other. While both involve forward motion on foot, jogging implies a faster pace and higher intensity than walking. Given the similarity in motion type but difference in intensity, this falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0416_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Push-up,0.0,"The ground truth action 'falldown' refers to a person losing balance and falling to the ground, which is a distinct and specific event. The predicted action 'Push-up' is a controlled, intentional exercise performed while on the ground, involving upper body strength. These actions are fundamentally different in intent, motion dynamics, and physical posture. A push-up does not represent any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of falling down, nor is it a plausible misinterpretation under the given constraints."
videos/session_0417_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Punching,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical whole-body movement, while the predicted action 'punching' is an upper-body striking motion. These actions are fundamentally different in both intent and biomechanics, with no significant semantic or temporal overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0418_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: arms raised above head,0.6,"The predicted action 'arms raised above head' describes a static pose that is a component of 'jumpingjack', but it does not fully capture the dynamic, repetitive nature of the full exercise.

videos/session_0420_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a dynamic, lower-body exercise involving a forward step and bending of the knees. The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture and does not capture any part of the lunge motion, even temporally. Given that 'lunge' is a specific, active movement, a generic static label like 'Standing' is incorrect and falls under the low-score category."
videos/session_0421_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, while the predicted action 'walking' describes forward locomotion. These are distinct actions with different motion patterns; walking does not inherently involve turning, nor is it a temporal part or semantic equivalent of turning. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0422_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: kicking,0.6,"The ground truth 'legraise' refers to a controlled lifting of the leg, typically from a lying or seated position, often as an abdominal or hip flexor exercise. The prediction 'kicking' involves a dynamic, forceful leg extension, which shares the use of leg movement but differs in intent, speed, and biomechanics. While both involve leg motion, 'kicking' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'legraise', but they are related enough to warrant a medium score."
videos/session_0423_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm movements. The prediction 'clapping' is a different rhythmic hand action but does not resemble drumming in motion pattern or intent. While both involve upper-body movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0424_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punch,1.0,"The prediction 'Punch' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'. Since boxing primarily involves punching motions, this is a semantically equivalent and specific match."

The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0427_eat.mp4,eat,Action: drinking,0.3,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they involve distinct actions and objects (e.g., cup vs. food). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal phase or semantic equivalent, making the prediction a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0428_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The prediction 'drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0429_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: adjusting glasses,0.1,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a hand moving across the face to clean or dry it, while the predicted action 'adjusting glasses' is a distinct behavior focused on repositioning eyewear. Although both involve hand-to-face contact, they serve different purposes and are not semantically equivalent or temporally related parts of the same activity. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0430_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending down,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending down' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking something up typically involves bending down to reach the object. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action sequence."
videos/session_0431_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jump,0.9,"The ground truth action 'jumprope' involves repeated jumping motions. The prediction 'Jump' captures the core dynamic movement of the activity, even if it omits the specific context of using a rope. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on action similarity rather than exact wording, this is a highly accurate and semantically appropriate prediction."
videos/session_0432_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: bending,0.6,"Mopping the floor typically involves bending over to reach the floor, so 'bending' is a plausible and related component of the action. However, it is less specific than the ground truth and does not fully capture the complete activity of mopping, which also includes arm movements and locomotion. Thus, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0433_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.6,"The predicted action 'touching head' is related to 'brushhair' as both involve hand-to-head contact, but it lacks specificity. Brushing hair implies a repeated, grooming motion with an implement (like a brush), whereas 'touching head' could refer to a brief or incidental contact. This is a plausible but ambiguous interpretation, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0434_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is a communicative gesture with a distinctly different motion pattern, intent, and muscle engagement. The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, this is a clear mismatch."

The prediction 'Right arm raised' describes only a static pose without any indication of motion or circular trajectory. While raising the arm may be part of initiating the drawing motion, it fails to capture the essential dynamic component of the action, making it largely incorrect."
videos/session_0443_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific circular hand or arm motion in a counter-clockwise direction. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a static or directional gesture that does not involve circular motion and is semantically distinct. While both may involve arm movement, pointing lacks the defining rotational component of drawing a circle, making it a largely incorrect match."

videos/session_0456_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Kicking,0.6,"The ground truth 'legraise' typically involves lifting one or both legs while lying down or seated, often as a core or leg exercise. The prediction 'kicking' involves dynamic leg movement but is generally more forceful and performed standing or in motion, differing in intent and form. While both involve leg motion, they are not exact or temporal equivalents; however, they are related enough to warrant a medium score due to partial semantic overlap in lower-body activity."
videos/session_0457_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves mimicking drumming motions, typically with rhythmic arm movements. 'Clapping' is a different rhythmic hand action but does not resemble drumming in motion pattern or intent.

videos/session_0465_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping,0.6,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are distinct cleaning actions involving different tools and motions (mop vs. broom, wet vs. dry). However, they are semantically related as floor-cleaning activities performed in a similar context and posture. While not equivalent, the prediction shows reasonable contextual understanding, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0466_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (e.g., a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion usually in response to an itch. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent or temporal parts of each other, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0467_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is a communicative gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

While both may involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0476_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down gesture that lacks the circular and directional specificity of the ground truth. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions with little overlap in intent or form."
videos/session_0477_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. The prediction 'Raising arm' is a generic motion that does not specifically indicate interaction with a stop sign. While raising an arm could be part of signaling, it is too vague and non-specific to reliably match the 'stopsign' label, especially since many unrelated actions also involve raising an arm. Thus, the prediction is largely inconsistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0478_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, possibly toward the body or in a controlled gesture. The prediction 'waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a rhythmic, communicative motion, which is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both involve hand movement, they serve different purposes and exhibit opposing directional patterns, making them largely dissimilar. Thus, the prediction is considered a low-match error."
videos/session_0479_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: taking a photo,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, interactive gesture involving repelling or pushing someone's hand away. The predicted action 'taking a photo' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap—it involves holding a device and posing, not repelling contact. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0480_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The prediction 'waving' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'handwave', as both describe the same intentional gesture of moving one's hand back and forth, typically for greeting or signaling."

The predicted action 'Eating' is entirely unrelated in both semantics and physical motion, representing a different activity with distinct biomechanics and intent. There is no temporal, categorical, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0485_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving a shift in body position such as leaning, sidestepping, or turning. The prediction 'turning' is a related motion that could plausibly be part of a dodging action, especially in a low-resolution thermal video where fine motion details may be ambiguous. However, 'turning' alone is less specific and could occur in many non-dodging contexts, so it does not fully capture the intent or dynamics of 'dodge'. This warrants a medium score."
videos/session_0486_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Jumping,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including approach, swing, and release of a ball, typically with a bent posture and arm motion. 'Jumping' is a completely different physical activity with no meaningful overlap or temporal relationship to bowling. It does not represent a plausible phase, abstraction, or semantic equivalent of the intended action."
videos/session_0487_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: waving,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' involves raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'waving', as waving typically includes lifting a hand and moving it. Given the low-resolution thermal video and the high-level nature of labels, this is a reasonable and contextually appropriate interpretation."
videos/session_0488_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, light contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'waving' involves a distinct, broader hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling. These actions are semantically and kinematically different, with no significant overlap in intent or movement pattern. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0489_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine motor hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen interactions or specific hand exercises. The predicted action 'Waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is minimal overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0490_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. The prediction 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not encompass or logically lead to drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and trajectory, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0491_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: Smoking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'smoking' is a deliberate, sustained behavior involving hand-to-mouth motion and inhalation. These actions are semantically and physically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0492_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Coughing,1.0,"The prediction 'Coughing' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'cough', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0493_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking—whereas the prediction 'Walking' suggests a normal, controlled gait. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' lacks the critical nuance of instability inherent to 'stagger'. This is not a temporal part nor a semantic equivalent, but a related yet significantly different action, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0494_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: hand to face,0.6,"The predicted action 'hand to face' is a plausible and common component of yawning, as people often bring their hand to their mouth or face while yawning. However, 'hand to face' is more general and could describe other actions (e.g., scratching, adjusting glasses), so it lacks the specificity of 'yawn'. This qualifies as a related but less specific prediction, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0495_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: talking on phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'blownose' involves a specific upper-body gesture focused on the nose, typically with a tissue or hand. The predicted action 'talking on phone' describes a completely different behavior involving holding a device to the ear and speaking.

Stretching often involves extending limbs, and arm extension is a common component of self-stretching routines."
videos/session_0497_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: touching head,0.9,"The ground truth action 'touchface' encompasses any instance of a person touching their face, which includes touching the head as a semantically overlapping and anatomically adjacent region. Given the low-resolution thermal video context and the inherent ambiguity in precise localization, 'touching head' is a highly plausible and specific interpretation of the intended action."
videos/session_0498_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a valid and highly indicative posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. Thus, it qualifies as a semantically equivalent and temporally appropriate representation of the action."

videos/session_0506_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending down,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending down' is a core component of the ground truth action 'pickup', as picking something up typically involves bending down to reach the object. This is a logical and temporally valid part of the action, warranting a high score."
videos/session_0507_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: raise arm,0.3,"The ground truth 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, outward pushing motion with the hand or arm, likely involving force or resistance. The prediction 'raise arm' describes a different movement—lifting the arm vertically—which does not capture the directional or interactive nature of pushing away. While both involve arm motion, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and trajectory, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0508_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: saluting,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'saluting' involve arm movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Saluting is a specific, formal gesture typically involving a rigid hand position near the forehead, whereas handwaving is a broader, often side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'saluting' does not qualify as an exact match, temporal part, or semantic equivalent, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0509_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a characteristic side-to-side or forward-backward motion of the arms, typically with a broom or similar tool. The prediction 'raising arm' describes a generic, vertical arm movement that does not capture the essential motion pattern of sweeping. While raising an arm could occur incidentally during sweeping, it is not a defining or temporally representative part of the action and is too vague and dissimilar to be considered correct."

However, they are distinct actions with different movement patterns—jumping rope involves arm motion and a specific rhythm, while running in place primarily involves leg motion. The prediction is related and plausible but not a temporal part or semantic equivalent of jumprope, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0556_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping,0.9,"Mopping the floor and sweeping are semantically similar cleaning actions that involve similar body movements (e.g., pushing a tool across the floor in a repetitive motion). While not identical, they are close enough in context and intent to warrant a high score, especially given the low-resolution thermal video input which may obscure fine-grained details distinguishing the two."
videos/session_0557_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: scratching head,0.3,"While both 'brushhair' and 'scratching head' involve hand-to-head contact, they represent distinct actions with different intent and motion patterns. Brushing hair typically involves repetitive, directional strokes with a tool (like a brush), whereas scratching is a brief, localized motion often due to itch. The VLM's prediction does not capture the core semantics or typical execution of 'brushhair', making it a related but incorrect action."
videos/session_0558_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement but is a distinct social gesture with a different motion pattern (side-to-side or up-and-down motion of the hand/arm without resistance). The two actions are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or part of the same activity category. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0559_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Clapping,0.0,"The ground truth action 'playphone' involves interacting with a mobile device, typically while holding it and looking at the screen.

videos/session_0568_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling context. The predicted action 'Waving' describes a dynamic hand gesture that is semantically unrelated to presenting or holding a stop sign. There is no temporal or contextual overlap between waving and displaying a stop sign, making this a completely different action."
videos/session_0569_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion of pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The prediction 'waving' involves moving the hand outward and back in a rhythmic gesture, which is semantically and kinematically distinct. While both involve hand movement, they serve different purposes and exhibit different motion patterns, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0570_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a dynamic, forceful motion of repelling or pushing someone's hand away, likely involving arm extension and resistance. The predicted action 'pointing' is a distinct gesture primarily involving finger extension to indicate direction or object, with no inherent pushing or repelling component.

videos/session_0575_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movement in a controlled, repetitive angular motion. The prediction 'Waving' describes a broad, rhythmic arm motion typically used for greeting, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, the intent, trajectory, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0576_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.3,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a rapid, evasive movement to avoid something, which typically involves lateral or sudden directional shifts. The prediction 'turning' describes a rotational motion that may occur during a dodge but is not sufficient on its own to constitute dodging—it lacks the essential evasive intent and dynamic nature. While loosely related, it is too generic and misses the core semantics of the action."
videos/session_0577_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: bending,0.6,"Bending is a common and plausible component of the bowling action (e.g., during the approach or release phase), but it is not specific enough to fully capture the distinct activity of bowling. Thus, it is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0578_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Pointing,0.9,"The ground truth 'liftupahand' refers to raising one hand, which is semantically very close to 'pointing', as pointing typically involves lifting a hand with an extended finger.

videos/session_0586_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video due to head/upper body motion, they are distinct behaviors with different intent and mechanics. Blowing one's nose typically involves holding a tissue and deliberate nasal clearing, whereas coughing is a reflexive throat/chest action. The VLM's prediction is related but not a temporal part, semantic equivalent, or valid instance of the ground truth action, warranting a low—but not zero—score due to partial similarity."

videos/session_0612_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Looking up and down,0.3,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing any self-chosen active movement, which should be dynamic. The prediction 'Looking up and down' describes a very limited, mostly static head motion that does not constitute a meaningful or representative action under the 'freestyle' category. It lacks the expected level of activity or engagement implied by the abstract label."
videos/session_0613_gym.mp4,gym,Action: shifting weight,0.8,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Shifting weight' describes a dynamic, intentional movement commonly associated with gym-related actions (e.g., balance adjustments during strength training or warm-ups).

videos/session_0670_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: raise right arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'sweep' involves a repetitive, lateral arm motion typically with a broom or similar tool, while the predicted action 'raise right arm' describes a single, vertical arm movement. Although both involve arm motion, raising an arm is not a typical component or temporal phase of sweeping and lacks the characteristic sweeping motion. The prediction is too generic and does not align semantically or temporally with the intended activity."
videos/session_0671_clap.mp4,clap,Action: waving,0.3,"While both 'clap' and 'waving' involve hand movements, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and motion patterns. Clapping involves hands moving toward each other to strike, whereas waving typically involves a side-to-side or up-and-down motion of one or both hands without contact. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase or equivalent of clapping, nor is it a plausible abstraction under the given constraints."

The predicted action 'waving' involves arm movement and is semantically unrelated to sliding. There is no temporal or conceptual overlap between waving and sliding, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0673_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion tracing a zigzag pattern, likely involving fine motor control or gestural movement. The prediction 'pointing' is a different, simpler gesture that does not capture the complexity or intent of drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm/hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different purposes, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0674_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: throwing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick evasive movement, typically involving sidestepping or leaning to avoid something. The predicted action 'throwing' is a distinct and unrelated motion focused on propelling an object, which does not align semantically or temporally with dodging. There is no significant overlap in intent or motion pattern between the two actions."
videos/session_0675_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: jump,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including approach, swing, and release of a ball, typically with a forward-leaning posture and arm motion. The predicted action 'jump' is a completely different physical activity with no meaningful overlap or temporal relationship to bowling. Jumping is not a typical component or precursor to bowling, nor is it a plausible interpretation under the constraints of abstract or partial labeling."
videos/session_0676_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: raising arm,1.0,"The predicted action 'raising arm' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'liftupahand', as both describe the same physical movement of elevating one's hand/arm."
videos/session_0677_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'tap' refers to a brief, deliberate contact (e.g., tapping a surface or object), while the predicted action 'Eating' involves a completely different set of movements and intent. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0678_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Raising arm,0.2,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The prediction 'Raising arm' describes a gross upper-body movement that does not capture the specific hand motion implied by the label. While both involve arm/hand movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and execution, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0679_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape. The predicted action 'waving' involves a different motion pattern (typically a side-to-side or up-and-down hand/arm movement) and does not correspond to drawing a triangle, even considering temporal partiality or abstraction. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct."
videos/session_0680_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: eating,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'eating' involves deliberate hand-to-mouth movements and chewing. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0681_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic upper-body movement, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static, full-body posture unrelated to coughing. Standing does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of coughing, nor is it a plausible component of the action. This constitutes a completely different activity, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0682_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking to the left,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or difficulty walking. The prediction 'Walking to the left' describes a controlled, directional movement that does not capture the instability or irregularity inherent in 'stagger'. While both involve locomotion, the semantic and kinematic differences are significant, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0683_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: touching face,0.3,"Yawning often involves touching or covering the mouth, so 'touching face' is loosely related but not a strong semantic match or temporal part of 'yawn'. However, it is not completely unrelated, warranting a low but non-zero score."
videos/session_0684_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: covering face,0.3,"The ground truth action 'blownose' refers to a specific, brief facial hygiene action involving the nose and a tissue or hand. The prediction 'covering face' is too generic and does not capture the essential nature of blowing one's nose—it could describe many unrelated actions (e.g., shielding from light, hiding face in embarrassment). While there is slight overlap (both involve the face), the predicted action lacks the specificity and intent of the true activity, placing it in the low-score range."
videos/session_0685_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: raise arms overhead,0.9,"The predicted action 'raise arms overhead' is a specific and common movement that falls under the broader category of 'stretchoneself'. Stretching often involves raising the arms overhead to elongate the torso and shoulders, making this prediction semantically consistent with the ground truth."
videos/session_0686_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Talking on phone,0.1,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves direct contact with the face, while the predicted action 'Talking on phone' typically involves holding a device near the ear or mouth but not necessarily touching the face in the same manner. Although there may be slight overlap (e.g., phone near face), the actions are semantically distinct and do not represent the same behavior or its temporal parts. Thus, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0687_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth action 'handshake', differing only in capitalization, which does not affect semantic meaning."
videos/session_0688_hug.mp4,hug,Action: conversing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'hug' involves close physical contact between individuals, while the predicted action 'conversing' implies verbal interaction without necessarily any physical contact. Although both may occur in social settings, they represent fundamentally different types of human activity—physical affection vs. communication—and are not semantically equivalent or temporally related parts of the same action."
videos/session_0689_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: shaking hands,0.1,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful, directional physical interaction, while the predicted action 'shaking hands' describes a consensual, cooperative gesture. These actions are semantically and physically distinct in intent, motion, and social context. There is no temporal or categorical overlap that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0690_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kick,1.0,"The predicted action 'kick' is a direct and semantically equivalent match to the ground truth 'kicksomeone', as it captures the core action of kicking, which is the defining movement in the labeled activity."
videos/session_0691_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' implies an aggressive, directed physical motion toward another person, while the predicted action 'waving' is a friendly, non-aggressive gesture. Although both involve arm movement, the intent, dynamics, and social context are fundamentally different, making this a near-complete mismatch."
videos/session_0692_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: standing,0.3,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies an interactive, communicative activity, which often involves gestures, facial expressions, or movement while talking. While 'standing' could be a posture during conversation, it is overly generic and static, failing to capture the core interactive nature of 'conversation'. Without evidence of interaction or communication in the prediction, it is only weakly related."
videos/session_0693_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and not strongly indicative of a typical gym activity (e.g., weightlifting, cardio machines). It falls into the medium score range as a related but generic action."

videos/session_0697_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist, often as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'bending' accurately captures the core physical motion involved in bowing, even if it lacks the specific contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement rather than intent, 'bending' is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid description of the action."
videos/session_0698_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,"The prediction 'lying down' is a highly plausible and semantically aligned posture for the ground truth action 'sleep'. While not an exact verbal match, lying down is a necessary and typical component of sleeping, especially in the context of thermal video where fine details are limited. This qualifies as a correct interpretation under temporal and postural reasoning."
videos/session_0699_dance.mp4,dance,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'dance' implies a dynamic, rhythmic movement, while the predicted action 'walking' is a fundamentally different type of locomotion with no inherent connection to dancing. Walking is not a temporal phase or specific instance of dancing, nor is it a plausible interpretation under the abstract label 'dance'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0700_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.6,"Walking and jogging are closely related locomotive activities, but they differ in intensity and speed. While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially at transition moments (e.g., slowing down from a jog to a walk). However, since 'walking' is less intense and distinct from 'jogging', it falls into the medium similarity range."
videos/session_0701_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: standing up,0.1,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies a sudden loss of balance and collapse to the ground, which is fundamentally different from 'standing up', an action involving rising from a lower position. These actions are temporally and semantically opposite; standing up is not a valid phase or variant of falling down."
videos/session_0702_jump.mp4,jump,Action: bend forward,0.2,"The ground truth action 'jump' is a dynamic, vertical movement involving both legs leaving the ground, while the predicted action 'bend forward' is a static or slow upper-body motion that does not involve jumping or its typical preparatory or recovery phases. The two actions are semantically and kinematically distinct, with no clear temporal or categorical overlap."
videos/session_0703_gym.mp4,gym,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth 'gym' implies a dynamic, exercise-related activity. 'Waving' is a distinct, non-exercise gesture that does not fall under typical gym activities or general physical exertion associated with the 'gym' label. It is neither a specific valid action nor a temporal part of such an activity, making it largely inconsistent with the expected behavior."
videos/session_0704_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: No human activity detected,0.0,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person is performing some form of voluntary, active movement. The prediction 'No human activity detected' directly contradicts this by asserting inactivity, which is incorrect for a dynamic and abstract label like 'freestyle'. This constitutes a complete mismatch and falls under hallucination or failure to detect activity."
videos/session_0705_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Arms raised above head,0.6,"The prediction 'Arms raised above head' describes a static pose that is a component of the dynamic action 'jumpingjack', but it does not capture the full repetitive, full-body motion characteristic of jumping jacks. While related and partially correct, it lacks specificity and dynamism, placing it in the medium score range."
videos/session_0706_squat.mp4,squat,Action: crouching,0.9,"The predicted action 'crouching' is a strong semantic equivalent to the ground truth 'squat', as both describe a similar body posture involving bending the knees and lowering the body. While not an exact lexical match, they are functionally and visually nearly identical in the context of human activity recognition, especially in low-resolution thermal video where fine distinctions may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0707_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: lunge,1.0,"The predicted action 'lunge' exactly matches the ground truth action 'lunge', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0708_turn.mp4,turn,Action: walking back and forth,0.3,"The ground truth action 'turn' implies a rotational movement of the body, typically around a vertical axis. The prediction 'walking back and forth' describes translational motion along a path, which is a fundamentally different type of movement. While both involve motion, they are not semantically equivalent, nor is walking back and forth a temporal part of turning. Therefore, the prediction does not match the ground truth action."
videos/session_0709_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Falling,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushup' is a specific, dynamic upper-body exercise involving controlled lowering and raising of the body. The prediction 'Falling' describes an uncontrolled, passive motion that is semantically and physically distinct from performing a pushup. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0710_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: kicking,0.6,"The ground truth 'legraise' refers to a controlled lifting of the leg, typically from a lying or seated position, often as an abdominal or hip-flexor exercise. The prediction 'kicking' involves a dynamic, forceful leg extension, which shares the use of leg movement but differs in intent, speed, and form. While both involve leg motion, kicking is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of legraise, but they are related enough to warrant a medium score."
videos/session_0711_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, percussive arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with both arms moving in a coordinated fashion near the body. The prediction 'waving' describes a different gesture—usually a single-arm, side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent, pattern, and context are distinct. 'Waving' is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of 'airdrum', nor is it a plausible interpretation under abstract or partial observation constraints."
videos/session_0712_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: punching,0.9,"The prediction 'punching' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'. While not an exact label match, it accurately captures the specific activity shown in the video clip, which aligns with the high-level category 'boxing'."

The predicted action 'Drinking' is a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible scenario where drinking is a part of answering a phone, nor are they related actions."
videos/session_0715_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.2,"While drinking and eating are both consumption-related activities, they are distinct actions with different physical motions (e.g., bringing a cup to the mouth vs. using utensils or hands to eat). The ground truth 'eat' does not encompass 'drinking' as a temporal part or semantic equivalent, making this a mismatch."
videos/session_0716_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The prediction 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth action 'drink'.
videos/session_0717_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: taking a photo,0.0,"The ground truth action 'wipeface' involves a person using their hand to wipe their face, which is a distinct and specific gesture. The predicted action 'taking a photo' describes a completely different activity with no semantic or temporal overlap. There is no plausible interpretation under which taking a photo constitutes wiping one's face, even considering partial or abstract interpretations."
videos/session_0718_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending forward,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending forward' is a key and characteristic component of the 'pickup' action, as picking something up typically involves bending forward to reach an object on the ground or a surface. This aligns well with the temporal partiality principle, where a logical sub-part of the action is considered correct."
videos/session_0719_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jump rope,1.0,The prediction 'jump rope' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth action 'jumprope'.
videos/session_0720_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: bending down,0.6,"Mopping the floor often involves bending down to reach the floor, so 'bending down' is a plausible and related component of the action. However, it is less specific than the ground truth and does not fully capture the complete activity of mopping, which typically includes repetitive wiping or scrubbing motions while holding a mop. Thus, it falls into the medium score range."
videos/session_0721_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Adjusting sunglasses,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushhair' involves grooming behavior focused on the hair, while the predicted action 'Adjusting sunglasses' is a completely different activity involving eyewear. There is no semantic overlap or temporal relationship between the two actions, and neither falls under a shared abstract category. This constitutes a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0722_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: putting on a hat,0.0,"The ground truth action 'bicepcurl' is a specific upper-body strength exercise involving repeated flexion of the elbow, typically with a weight. The predicted action 'putting on a hat' involves a completely different motion (reaching upward to place an object on the head) and shares no semantic, functional, or temporal relationship with a bicep curl. This is a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0723_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: using mobile phone,1.0,"The prediction 'using mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth action 'playphone', as both describe the same high-level activity of interacting with a mobile device."
videos/session_0724_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'brushteeth' involves specific upper-body movements near the mouth with a toothbrush, typically in a bathroom setting. The predicted action 'drinking' implies holding a container and consuming liquid, which is a distinctly different behavior with different motion patterns and intent. While both may involve hand-to-mouth motion, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or plausible interpretations of each other in the context of thermal video HAR."
videos/session_0725_type.mp4,type,Action: Typing,1.0,"The prediction 'Typing' is a direct and exact match for the ground truth action 'type', as both refer to the same activity of inputting text on a keyboard."
videos/session_0726_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'thumbup' refers to a specific hand gesture where the thumb is raised, typically as a signal of approval or acknowledgment. The predicted action 'pointing' involves extending the index finger to indicate direction or draw attention, which is a distinctly different hand gesture with different intent and form. While both involve hand movements, they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or interchangeable under any reasonable interpretation of the label. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0727_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'thumbdown' refers to a specific hand gesture indicating disapproval, while the predicted action 'Waving' describes a different hand motion typically used for greeting or signaling.

videos/session_0731_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' implies a specific, controlled circular hand or arm motion in a counterclockwise direction. The prediction 'Waving' describes a different, typically back-and-forth or up-and-down hand motion, which is not semantically equivalent nor a temporal part of drawing a counterclockwise circle. The actions are visually and functionally distinct, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0732_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"The ground truth action 'stopsign' implies the person is holding or interacting with a stop sign, likely in a static or signaling pose. 'Waving' is a completely different gesture with distinct intent and motion, showing no semantic or temporal relation to 'stopsign'."
videos/session_0733_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: No human activity detected,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' implies a specific human movement involving pulling hands inward, which constitutes detectable human activity. The VLM's prediction of 'No human activity detected' directly contradicts this and indicates a failure to recognize any presence or motion of a person, resulting in a completely incorrect response."
videos/session_0734_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve hand movement, the intent and motion dynamics are fundamentally different, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0735_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'handwave' involves a distinct arm movement to signal or greet, while the predicted action 'drinking' implies a completely different activity involving holding and consuming a beverage.

While arm movements might accompany sliding, they are neither sufficient nor characteristic enough to be considered a correct or partial match for the high-level label 'slide'."
videos/session_0739_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Waving,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a fine motor activity involving drawing a zigzag pattern, likely with hand/arm movements in a controlled, repetitive angular motion. The prediction 'Waving' describes a broad, rhythmic arm motion typically used for greeting or signaling, which is semantically and kinematically distinct from drawing a zigzag. While both involve arm movement, the intent, trajectory, and context differ significantly, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0740_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: shuffling,0.6,"The ground truth action 'dodge' implies a quick, evasive movement, often involving lateral or sudden shifts in position. 'Shuffling' suggests small, sliding steps, which may partially overlap with dodging if it involves rapid foot adjustments to evade something. However, shuffling is generally slower and less directional than dodging, making it related but not fully equivalent. This falls into the medium score range due to plausible but imprecise alignment."
videos/session_0741_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: dancing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'bowling' involves a specific sequence of movements including arm swinging and ball release, typically in a forward-leaning stance.

videos/session_0883_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'pullhandin' suggests a specific motion involving pulling one's hand inward, likely toward the body. The prediction 'Pointing' describes a distinctly different hand gesture that involves extending the finger outward, which is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of pulling the hand in. The actions are functionally and kinematically dissimilar."
videos/session_0884_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushhandaway' implies a forceful or deliberate motion of pushing someone's hand away, which is distinct from 'waving', a gesture typically involving rhythmic, open-handed motion for greeting or signaling. While both involve arm movement, the intent and motion pattern differ significantly, making this a related but incorrect prediction that falls into the low-score range."

These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap."
videos/session_0897_cough.mp4,cough,Action: hand to face,0.6,"The predicted action 'hand to face' is a plausible and commonly associated gesture during coughing, as people often cover their mouth when coughing. However, it is not a definitive indicator of coughing on its own, as the same gesture could occur in other contexts (e.g., scratching face, adjusting glasses). Thus, it is related but less specific than the ground truth 'cough'."
videos/session_0898_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies an unsteady, irregular gait—often associated with imbalance, intoxication, or injury—whereas 'walking' suggests a steady, controlled motion. While both involve locomotion, 'walking' fails to capture the distinctive instability inherent in 'staggering'.

There is no temporal or contextual overlap between these actions, and 'Phone call' does not represent a plausible part, abstraction, or variant of 'wipeface'."
videos/session_0963_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'pickup' typically involves bending down to retrieve an object. The predicted action 'bending' is a core and necessary component of the 'pickup' motion, making it a valid temporal and semantic part of the intended activity."
videos/session_0964_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: running in place,0.6,"Both 'jumprope' and 'running in place' are dynamic, high-energy activities that involve repetitive vertical motion and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video. While not the same action, they are closely related forms of cardio exercise, making the prediction reasonably plausible but not exact or a direct temporal part of jump roping."
videos/session_0965_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,"The predicted action 'handshake' exactly matches the ground truth action 'handshake', indicating a correct and precise recognition of the activity."
videos/session_0966_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug'.
videos/session_0967_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' is a dynamic, interactive behavior that involves physical contact or forceful motion toward another person. The prediction 'standing' describes a static, non-interactive posture and does not represent any temporal phase or semantic equivalent of pushing someone. Given the clear dynamism implied by 'pushsomeone', a generic static label like 'standing' is incorrect and warrants a low score."
videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: talking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'kicksomeone' is a dynamic, aggressive physical interaction, while the predicted action 'talking' is a static, non-physical, and socially passive activity. There is no semantic, temporal, or contextual overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Salute,0.0,"The ground truth action 'punchsomeone' involves an aggressive, dynamic motion directed at another person, while the predicted action 'Salute' is a respectful, static gesture with no overlap in intent, motion, or context. The two actions are semantically and physically distinct."
videos/session_0970_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: walking,0.1,"The ground truth action 'conversation' implies social interaction, typically involving people standing or sitting still while talking. The predicted action 'walking' is a completely different activity with no clear semantic or temporal relationship to conversation. Walking does not constitute a logical part of conversing, nor is it a specific instance of an abstract label like 'conversation'. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and somewhat generic compared to typical gym activities like weightlifting or cardio machines. It is related and not incorrect, but lacks the specificity expected for a high score."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth 'gym' implies dynamic physical activity such as exercising or weightlifting. 'Pointing' is a static, non-exercise gesture that does not align with the expected actions under the 'gym' category, making it largely inconsistent with the label."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: bending down,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates the person can perform any arbitrary action. The prediction 'bending down' is a specific, plausible physical movement that falls within the scope of freestyle activity, making it a valid and semantically appropriate match."
videos/session_0974_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.6,"The ground truth 'gym' is an abstract label encompassing various physical activities. 'Walking' is a plausible form of exercise that could occur in a gym context, but it is less specific and somewhat generic compared to typical gym activities like weightlifting or cardio machines. It is related and not incorrect, but lacks the specificity expected for a high score."
videos/session_0975_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: walking,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' indicates that the person can perform any action of their choice. 'Walking' is a valid, specific action that falls under this open-ended category, making the prediction correct and reasonably specific."
