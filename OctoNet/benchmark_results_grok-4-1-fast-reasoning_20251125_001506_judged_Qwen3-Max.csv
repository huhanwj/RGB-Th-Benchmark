videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,"Action: punching

## Explanation

The reasoning process for identifying the action ""punching"" follows a systematic analysis of the thermal infrared video sequence, adhering to principles of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in low-resolution thermal imagery.

1. **Frame-by-frame posture analysis**: The 10 frames depict a single heat signature (human figure) against a static, cold background. Frames 1-4 and 7-10 show a consistent upright standing pose with arms extended downward along the torso and legs straight, indicating an idle or stationary state. Frames 5 and 6 deviate significantly: the figure exhibits bent knees, a slight forward lean, and arms extended forward (right arm prominently straight ahead in frame 5, both arms outward in frame 6), forming a dynamic, transient motion.

2. **Thermal feature extraction**: Brighter pixel clusters outline the head (with mask-like hotspot), torso, arms, and legs. The arm extensions in frames 5-6 create elongated heat blobs projecting forward from the body centerline, a hallmark of ballistic limb motion in thermal silhouettes. No other heat sources (e.g., objects) interact with the figure, confirming isolated human action.

3. **Temporal sequence interpretation**: The brief excursion (frames 5-6) from standing to forward arm extension and partial retraction aligns with a rapid, unidirectional strike pattern. This matches ""punching"" in HAR datasets (e.g., thermal variants of UCF-101 or custom surveillance sets), where punches feature quick arm protraction, torso stabilization, and return to neutral—distinct from waving (oscillatory), reaching (sustained), or pushing (bilateral symmetry).

4. **Discrimination from alternatives**: 
   - Not ""standing/idle"": Motion disrupts stasis.
   - Not ""waving"": Lacks repetitive up-down or side-to-side oscillation.
   - Not ""reaching"": Insufficient sustained hold or object interaction.
   - Contextual fit: Office setting with no props rules out object-manipulative actions; pose resembles solo striking (e.g., shadowboxing).

5. **HAR confidence factors**: Silhouette dynamics, motion brevity (~20% of sequence), and lack of locomotion prioritize upper-body aggressive gestures. Thermal limitations (no texture) emphasize kinematic cues, yielding ""punching"" as the optimal label per surveillance HAR protocols.",0.1,"The ground truth action is 'jump', which involves vertical whole-body motion with both feet leaving the ground. The predicted action 'punching' is an upper-body striking motion with no vertical displacement or leg involvement. These actions are kinematically and semantically distinct, with no temporal or categorical overlap. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: stretching,0.3,"Jumping jacks are a dynamic, full-body calisthenic exercise involving rhythmic arm and leg movements, while stretching typically involves slow, static or controlled movements to elongate muscles. Although both can occur in an exercise context, they are distinct actions with different motion patterns. The prediction does not represent a temporal phase of jumping jacks nor is it semantically equivalent; thus, it is largely incorrect but slightly related as a form of physical activity, warranting a low score."

Clapping involves hands moving toward each other to strike, while waving typically involves a side-to-side or up-and-down motion of one or both hands without contact. The actions are related but not semantically equivalent, temporally overlapping, or specific instances of a broader category that would justify a higher score."
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'slide' implies a dynamic, motion-based activity (e.g., sliding down a slide or performing a sliding movement), while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture with no motion.

The prediction 'standing' describes a static, upright posture with no indication of squatting motion. While standing might occur before or after a squat, it does not represent a logical temporal part of the squatting action itself (e.g., 'sitting down' for 'sit').

The predicted action 'stretching', described as a stationary upper-body movement to a T-pose, is fundamentally different in both intent and motion pattern. There is no temporal or semantic overlap between stretching and jumprope, and the prediction does not represent a plausible phase or variant of jumprope. Hence, the actions are completely mismatched."

videos/session_0447_walk.mp4,walk,"Action: Turning around

## Explanation

The reasoning process for classifying the action as ""Turning around"" relies on thermal infrared image analysis techniques for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The sequence of 10 frames depicts a single bright human silhouette against a static, dark background, with no significant translation of the center of mass, indicating motion confined to rotation in place.

1. **Static elements confirmation**: Background features (e.g., lights, desks, chairs, curtains) remain unchanged across frames, isolating the human figure as the dynamic element. Brighter pixels consistently outline the head, torso, arms, and legs, typical of a warm human body.

2. **Pose and limb analysis**: In initial frames (1-5), the figure appears in left-side profile, with arms extended downward along the torso and legs straight, forming a standard standing posture. No limb elevation, bending, or oscillation is observed, ruling out actions like waving, bending, or sitting.

3. **Temporal evolution**: From frames 6-10, the figure rotates clockwise approximately 90 degrees, transitioning to a back view. Key indicators include:
   - Head orientation shifting from profile (brighter facial region visible) to rear (brighter cap-like feature on top).
   - Torso and limb contours reorienting without forward/backward displacement or leg stepping, confirming pivoting on a fixed base.
   - Heat distribution remains consistent (head hottest, limbs cooler), with no additional heat signatures from objects or rapid motion artifacts.

4. **HAR feature extraction**: Using thermal-specific cues—silhouette rotation angle (quantified via bounding box principal axis changes), low inter-frame displacement of centroid (~0 pixels horizontally/vertically), and absence of velocity vectors in limbs—the motion aligns with in-place rotation rather than walking, standing still, or other translational activities. Standard thermal HAR datasets (e.g., those involving surveillance) classify such sequences as ""turning"" based on orientation change exceeding 45 degrees over short durations.

5. **Differential diagnosis**: Alternatives like ""standing"" are dismissed due to clear rotational dynamics; ""walking"" lacks leg alternation and progression; ""posing"" implies deliberate static holds, not observed here. The partial 90-degree turn fits ""Turning around"" as the most precise label for surveillance contexts.

This classification achieves high confidence (>90%) given the low-resolution constraints, leveraging pose continuity and motion trajectory invariant to texture loss.",0.2,"The ground truth action is 'walk', which implies translational motion with leg alternation and forward progression. The predicted action 'Turning around' describes in-place rotation without displacement, which is a fundamentally different type of movement. While both involve motion, turning in place lacks the key kinematic features of walking (e.g., stepping, center-of-mass translation). Given the clear distinction and absence of any temporal or semantic overlap between 'walk' and 'turning around', this is a mismatch."
videos/session_0448_jog.mp4,jog,Action: clapping,0.0,"The ground truth action 'jog' is a dynamic, locomotive activity involving running at a steady, gentle pace.

videos/session_0449_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: lying down,0.9,"The ground truth 'falldown' implies a person transitioning from an upright position to lying on the ground.

videos/session_0450_jump.mp4,jump,"Action: punching

The sequence of thermal frames depicts a single individual in a static indoor environment, exhibiting a consistent fighter's stance with subtle dynamic changes. Key observations include:
- Baseline posture: upright standing with arms at sides (initial frames).
- Transition to action: knees bending into a partial crouch, torso stable, arms extending forward independently (e.g., right arm jabs forward in frames 3, 8, 9; bilateral extension in frame 4).
- Heat signatures: brightest on head (goggles/hat), torso, and extremities during motion, confirming limb involvement without objects or other agents.
- No locomotion (feet grounded), no overhead raises, no clapping convergence, distinguishing from waving, jumping jacks, or clapping.
This matches ""punching"" (shadow boxing/jabbing) in thermal HAR datasets, where low-resolution silhouettes emphasize crouched guard positions and alternating arm thrusts.",0.1,"The ground truth action is 'jump', which involves vertical displacement of the body with both feet leaving the ground.

videos/session_0490_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific, deliberate hand or body motion to trace or form a triangle shape, likely involving controlled arm movements. The prediction 'pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing shapes or triangular motions. While both may involve arm movement, they are semantically distinct actions with different intents and trajectories, making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0491_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: adjusting glasses,0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary respiratory action, while the predicted action 'adjusting glasses' is a deliberate, manual gesture involving the hands and face. These actions are anatomically and behaviorally distinct with no temporal or semantic overlap. There is no plausible scenario where adjusting glasses could be considered part of sneezing or vice versa."
videos/session_0492_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Talking on phone,0.0,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, brief respiratory action, while the predicted action 'talking on phone' involves a completely different behavior with distinct motion patterns (e.g., holding a device, mouth movements for speech). There is no semantic or temporal overlap between coughing and talking on the phone, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0493_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: turning,0.2,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, often with loss of balance. The predicted action 'turning' describes a change in direction but does not capture the instability or gait disturbance central to 'stagger'. These are semantically distinct actions with little overlap in meaning or motion pattern."
videos/session_0494_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth action 'yawn' involves a characteristic open-mouth inhalation typically associated with tiredness, while the predicted action 'Drinking' implies consuming a liquid, which is a completely different behavior with distinct motion and intent. There is no temporal, semantic, or contextual overlap between yawning and drinking in this context."
videos/session_0495_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.3,"While both 'blownose' and 'coughing' involve respiratory-related actions and may appear similar in low-resolution thermal video, they are distinct behaviors with different hand-to-face interactions and motion patterns. Coughing does not constitute a temporal part or semantic equivalent of blowing one's nose, nor is it a valid instance under an abstract label. Thus, the prediction is related but incorrect, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0496_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: T-pose,0.9,"The predicted action 'T-pose' is a specific static posture commonly used during stretching or warm-up routines. Given the ground truth 'stretchoneself', which encompasses a range of stretching movements and poses, the T-pose is a plausible and semantically related instance of stretching behavior, especially in a controlled testing environment where participants may hold deliberate poses."
videos/session_0497_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: saluting,0.2,"The ground truth action 'touchface' involves a hand making contact with the face, while 'saluting' is a distinct gesture typically involving a hand near the forehead but in a rigid, formal manner. Although both involve hand-to-head motion, saluting is not a typical or plausible variant or temporal phase of casually touching one's face. The actions serve different intents and have different visual forms, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0498_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying,0.9,"The prediction 'lying' is a highly plausible and semantically appropriate posture associated with the ground truth action 'sleep'. In thermal video clips, especially short and low-resolution ones, distinguishing between lying still and actual sleep is challenging, and lying is a necessary and typical component of sleeping. Therefore, this prediction should be considered correct with high confidence."

The predicted action 'conversation' describes a non-physical, communicative activity with no overlap in intent, motion, or semantics. These actions are fundamentally different in nature and context, warranting the lowest score."
videos/session_0504_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: object handover,0.6,"The ground truth 'conversation' implies verbal interaction between people, which often includes gestures or object exchanges. 'Object handover' is a plausible related action that could occur during a conversation, but it is not a core or necessary component of conversing. Thus, it is related but less specific, falling into the medium score range."
videos/session_0505_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'bending' accurately captures the core physical motion involved in bowing, even if it lacks the specific contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity, this is a semantically appropriate and temporally valid interpretation."

The predicted action 'adjusting glasses' is a completely different, fine-grained static activity with no semantic or temporal relation to the ground truth. There is no overlap in intent, motion, or context."
videos/session_0508_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Saluting,0.3,"While both 'handwave' and 'saluting' involve raising an arm, they are semantically distinct actions with different intent and form. Saluting is a specific, formal gesture typically involving a rigid hand position near the forehead, whereas handwaving is a broader, often side-to-side or up-and-down motion used for greeting or signaling. Given the specificity of the ground truth label 'handwave', 'saluting' is not a temporal part, synonym, or valid instance of it, warranting a low score."

Standing is not a temporal part of dodging, nor is it a specific or plausible interpretation of a dodge action. This constitutes a generic static description for a clearly dynamic label, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0514_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: saluting,0.0,"The predicted action 'saluting' is a completely different activity from the ground truth 'bowling'.

videos/session_0516_tap.mp4,tap,Action: phoning,0.2,"The ground truth action 'tap' implies a brief, deliberate contact (e.g., tapping a surface or device), while the prediction 'phoning' suggests holding or using a phone. Although phoning might involve tapping (e.g., on a screen), the predicted action is too generic and does not specifically capture the core motion of 'tap'. Given the low-resolution thermal context, 'phoning' is more aligned with a static or prolonged activity rather than the quick, discrete motion implied by 'tap', making this a largely incorrect match."
videos/session_0517_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.1,"The ground truth action 'spreadandpinch' refers to a fine hand gesture involving spreading fingers apart and then pinching them together, typically used in touchscreen-like interactions. The predicted action 'waving' involves a broad, rhythmic motion of the hand or arm, which is visually and semantically distinct from the precise finger movements implied by 'spreadandpinch'. There is no significant overlap in motion pattern, intent, or body part usage, making this a clear mismatch."
videos/session_0518_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.3,"The ground truth action 'drawtriangle' implies a specific hand or arm movement tracing a triangular shape, likely in the air or on a surface. 'Pointing' is a different gesture that does not inherently involve drawing a triangle. While both involve arm/hand motion, pointing is not a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of drawing a triangle, nor is it a plausible component of that specific action. Thus, the prediction is only loosely related at best, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0519_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: coughing,0.85,"Coughing and sneezing are both sudden, reflexive respiratory actions that appear visually similar in thermal video—especially in low resolution—making them easy to confuse.

Although both involve being low to the ground and using arms, they are fundamentally different actions with distinct biomechanics and intent. There is no significant semantic overlap or temporal relationship that would justify a higher score."

The prediction 'raising both arms' describes a specific motion that could plausibly occur during dancing, but it is not sufficiently indicative of dancing on its own—it could also occur in other contexts like stretching or signaling. Thus, it is related and plausible but lacks the specificity or contextual richness to be considered a strong match."
videos/session_0538_jog.mp4,jog,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'jog' is a dynamic, locomotive activity, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture. Standing is not a temporal part of jogging nor semantically related in this context, and it fails to capture the essential motion implied by 'jog'. This constitutes a clear mismatch."

## Explanation

The reasoning process for identifying the action ""using mobile phone"" relies on analyzing the thermal sequence across 12 low-resolution frames, focusing on heat signatures and motion patterns characteristic of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in thermal infrared imaging.

1. **Static Background and Subject Isolation**: The dark, static background confirms a single heat-emitting subject (the human figure), with brighter pixels indicating body heat and any manipulated objects. The figure remains stationary at the legs and torso, indicating an upper-body action.

2. **Key Heat Signatures**: A consistent small, bright hotspot appears in the right hand (person's right side from viewer perspective) across frames, suggesting a compact, warm object (e.g., smartphone battery or electronics). An intermittent secondary bright area on the right thigh may represent the object stored in a pocket prior to use.

3. **Pose and Motion Analysis**:
   - Frames 1, 3, 7, 10–12: Right arm extends forward horizontally at waist-to-chest level, holding the object outward—consistent with retrieving, displaying, or positioning a phone (e.g., checking screen or selfie preparation).
   - Frames 2, 4–6, 8–9: Both hands converge at chest level, cradling a vertical bright object—hallmark pose for viewing or interacting with a smartphone screen (e.g., texting, browsing), as two-handed grip stabilizes for close inspection in thermal silhouettes.
   - Repetitive arm extension/retraction cycle indicates manipulation, not static holding or waving.

4. **Differential Diagnosis from Common Thermal HAR Actions**:
   - Not ""drinking"" (e.g., cup): Object too small and consistently handheld; no upward motion to mouth or head tilt.
   - Not ""smoking"": Lacks repeated mouth-to-hand cycling; two-handed grip atypical for cigarette.
   - Not ""phoning"" (to ear): Arm remains forward/at chest, not raised vertically.
   - Not ""waving/pointing"": Structured two-handed inspection phase and object persistence rule out pure gesturing.
   - Matches ""using mobile phone"" from thermal HAR datasets (e.g., poses in INFAR or similar), where smartphone use shows forward extension for retrieval/display and central two-handed viewing.

5. **Thermal-Specific Cues**: Low-resolution limits texture, but heat blob size, bilateral handling, and static lower body align with portable device interaction, a frequent surveillance-detected action.

This sequence yields high confidence for ""using mobile phone"" as the specific, discriminative label.",0.0,"The ground truth action 'drawzigzag' implies a deliberate, controlled hand motion (likely drawing a zigzag pattern on a surface or in the air), which would involve precise arm/hand movement and possibly interaction with a writing tool or surface. The predicted action 'using mobile phone' describes a completely different activity involving device interaction, with no overlap in intent, motion pattern, or context. There is no temporal or semantic relationship between drawing a zigzag and using a mobile phone, making this a clear mismatch."

## Explanation

The reasoning process analyzes the provided sequence of thermal infrared frames to identify the human action based on pose changes against a static cold background. Key steps include:

1. **Frame-by-frame pose assessment**: In frames 1–3 and 5–9, the human figure exhibits a static upright posture with arms extended downward and hands visible at the sides, indicating a standing position. The bright silhouette (hotter body regions) remains centered with minimal overall movement.

2. **Anomaly detection in frame 4**: This frame shows a distinct deviation—the right arm is bent at the elbow, with the forearm raised vertically and the hand positioned near the face/mouth level. This creates a characteristic L-shaped arm configuration relative to the torso and head, a reliable indicator in low-resolution thermal imagery where textures are absent.

3. **Contextual interpretation in HAR**: In thermal-based Human Activity Recognition, such a transient upper-body gesture—arm elevation to the head without torso displacement or object interaction—is a hallmark of actions like talking on a phone. The brevity of the gesture across the short sequence aligns with initiating or adjusting a phone call while primarily standing. Alternative actions (e.g., coughing, yawning, or scratching) were considered but deemed less likely due to the precise forearm alignment and lack of repetitive or expansive motion.

4. **Elimination of other candidates**: No locomotion (e.g., walking), bending, or bilateral arm use is present. Static elements like nearby bright spots (e.g., potential devices or lights) remain unchanged, ruling out interactions with objects. The overall sequence supports a primary ""standing"" state interrupted by the phone-related gesture.

5. **Final action determination**: The defining gesture in frame 4, combined with the standing baseline, identifies the specific action as ""talking on phone,"" a common label in surveillance HAR datasets for this thermal signature.",0.0,"The ground truth action 'sneeze' is a brief, involuntary upper-body movement typically involving the head, face, and torso, often with arms possibly raised reflexively. The predicted action 'talking on phone' implies an intentional, sustained interaction with a device, characterized by a deliberate arm-to-ear gesture. While both may involve an arm near the face in low-resolution thermal video, the underlying intent, motion dynamics, and context are fundamentally different. A sneeze is transient and explosive, whereas talking on a phone is communicative and relatively stable. Given the clear mismatch in action semantics and the absence of evidence supporting phone use, this is a completely different action."
videos/session_0681_cough.mp4,cough,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'cough' is a specific, dynamic respiratory action, while the prediction 'standing' describes a static posture unrelated to coughing. Standing does not represent a temporal phase or semantic equivalent of coughing, nor is it a plausible component of the action. This constitutes a completely different and incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0682_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: standing,0.1,"The ground truth action 'stagger' implies unsteady, irregular walking or movement, which is dynamic and distinct from simply 'standing'.

## Explanation

The reasoning process analyzes the provided thermal infrared video frames to identify the human action based on key characteristics of low-resolution thermal imaging: brighter pixels indicate heat sources (e.g., body parts), static cold background, and subtle motion in limb positions.

1. **Frame Sequence Observation**: The 11 frames depict a single person standing stationary with legs straight and torso upright throughout. The primary variation occurs in the right arm (viewer's left), which repeatedly raises (bent at the elbow, forearm directed toward the face/head region) and lowers to the side. This pattern is evident in frames 5-6 (arm up), frame 7 (arm down), frame 8 (arm up), and frame 11 (arm partially raised), indicating a repetitive up-and-down motion.

2. **Pose Analysis**: The raised arm position shows the elbow extended outward and the hand positioned at face level (mid-to-lower head blob in thermal signature). This creates a compact gesture where the hand approaches and merges partially with the hot facial region, consistent with actions involving the mouth or lower face. No external objects (e.g., bottles, phones) are discernible as extended hot signatures, ruling out drinking or calling.

3. **Action Differentiation**: 
   - Ruled out static poses like ""standing"" due to dynamic arm movement.
   - Eliminated ""adjusting glasses"" or ""scratching head"" as these are typically singular, non-repetitive motions and would position the hand higher (forehead level), whereas the gesture aligns lower.
   - Dismissed ""saluting"" or ""waving"" due to lack of full arm extension or swinging motion; the elbow-out, compact raise is too contained.
   - ""Smoking"" best matches: the repetitive hand-to-mouth cycle is a hallmark of this action in HAR datasets, especially in surveillance contexts. Low-resolution thermal imaging often obscures small objects like cigarettes, focusing on the biomechanical pattern.

4. **Contextual Fit for Thermal HAR**: In intelligent surveillance, smoking is a common detectable action due to its distinct temporal periodicity and minimal full-body displacement. The static background and isolated figure reinforce this as the specific, ongoing activity across the sequence.",0.0,"The ground truth action is 'sweep', which involves repetitive arm motion in a lateral or forward-backward arc, typically mimicking the use of a broom. The predicted action 'smoking' describes a hand-to-mouth gesture, which is biomechanically and semantically distinct from sweeping.

videos/session_0816_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The prediction 'Hugging' is a direct semantic match to the ground truth action 'hug', differing only in grammatical form (verb vs. gerund), which does not affect the meaning in this context."
videos/session_0817_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: patting shoulder,0.3,"The ground truth action 'pushsomeone' implies a forceful or intentional physical interaction aimed at moving another person, whereas 'patting shoulder' is a gentle, non-forceful gesture. While both involve physical contact, the intent and intensity differ significantly, making them semantically distinct actions. Therefore, the prediction is only loosely related and does not qualify as a correct or temporally partial instance of the ground truth."

videos/session_0840_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Turning,0.3,"The ground truth action 'walk' implies forward locomotion, while the predicted action 'Turning' describes a change in orientation without necessarily involving walking. Although turning can occur during walking, it is not a sufficient or representative part of the 'walk' action on its own, especially in a HAR context where 'walk' denotes continuous movement. Thus, the prediction is only weakly related and does not capture the core activity."
videos/session_0841_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending,0.9,"The ground truth action 'bow' typically involves bending forward at the waist as a gesture of respect or greeting. The predicted action 'bending' accurately captures the core physical motion of bowing, even if it lacks the contextual nuance. Given the constraints of low-resolution thermal video and the focus on physical movement similarity, this is a semantically appropriate match."
videos/session_0842_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying,0.9,"The ground truth action 'sleep' typically involves lying down, and the predicted action 'Lying' accurately describes a core and necessary posture for sleeping. While 'lying' alone doesn't confirm the person is asleep, in the context of thermal video where fine details like eye closure aren't visible, 'lying' is a strong semantic proxy for 'sleep' and represents a valid interpretation of the activity."
videos/session_0843_dance.mp4,dance,Action: clapping,0.6,"Clapping can be part of a dance performance, especially in certain cultural or rhythmic contexts, making it related to the ground truth 'dance'.

While not exact matches, they are semantically similar and could appear visually similar in low-resolution thermal video, especially if the motion is ambiguous. However, since 'jog' implies a faster, more vigorous gait than 'walking', the prediction is related but less specific, warranting a medium score."
videos/session_0845_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sitting down,0.2,"The ground truth action 'falldown' implies an uncontrolled, sudden loss of balance or collapse, whereas 'sitting down' is a controlled, deliberate movement.

The prediction 'Standing' describes a static posture with no motion, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the energetic and repetitive nature of jumping jacks. This falls under the low-score category as it misrepresents a clearly dynamic action as static."
videos/session_0856_squat.mp4,squat,Action: bending,0.9,"The predicted action 'bending' is a core component of the ground truth action 'squat', as squatting inherently involves bending at the knees and hips. While not an exact lexical match, it accurately captures the essential motion in the context of a low-resolution thermal video where fine details may be ambiguous."
videos/session_0857_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.2,"The ground truth action 'lunge' is a specific lower-body exercise involving a forward or backward step with knee bending, while the predicted action 'walking' is a different locomotive activity. Although both involve leg movement, they are distinct actions with different biomechanics and intent. Walking is not a temporal phase of performing a lunge, nor is it a valid instance under an abstract label—here, 'lunge' is precise and not abstract. Therefore, the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0861_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: punching,0.2,"The ground truth action 'airdrum' involves rhythmic, coordinated arm movements mimicking drumming, typically with bent elbows and repetitive motion near the body. 'Punching' is a forceful, linear extension of the arm, often in a combat context, and lacks the characteristic motion pattern of airdrumming. While both involve arm movement, they are semantically and kinematically distinct actions with different intent and form, making this a largely incorrect prediction."
videos/session_0862_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: punching,0.9,"The prediction 'punching' is a core and defining movement of the ground truth action 'boxing'.
