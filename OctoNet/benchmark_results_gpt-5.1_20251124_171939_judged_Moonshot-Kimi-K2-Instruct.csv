videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling down and then standing up,1.0,"The prediction explicitly identifies the key action 'falling down', which is the core component of the ground truth 'falldown'. The additional phrase 'and then standing up' does not contradict the fall event; it merely describes what happens afterward. Thus the prediction is semantically equivalent to the ground truth."
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Squatting,0.3,"Squatting is a distinct lower-body exercise that involves bending the knees and lowering the hips, whereas jumping is an explosive upward motion. While both are leg-focused movements, they are fundamentally different actions, so the prediction is only weakly related."

videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squatting,1.0,The prediction 'Squatting' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'squat'.
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Bending down,0.7,"A lunge involves a significant bend of the front leg and lowering of the torso, so ""bending down"" captures a key visual aspect of the movement. However, it is less specific than ""lunge"" and could describe other motions (e.g., picking something up), hence a medium-high score."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turning around (rotating in place),1.0,The prediction 'Turning around (rotating in place)' is a direct and exact match for the ground truth action 'turn'.
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Crawling,0.0,'Crawling' is a fundamentally different motion from a 'pushup'; the two actions involve distinct body postures and movement patterns and are not semantically or temporally related.
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,'Walking' and 'legraise' are fundamentally different actions; walking is locomotion while legraise is a specific abdominal/core exercise. No temporal or semantic overlap exists.
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.7,"Waving is a rhythmic arm motion that closely resembles the arm-swinging gestures of air-drumming; while not identical, it captures the same general upper-body movement pattern and is therefore a related, moderately specific match."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Throwing an object,0.7,"'Throwing an object' is not boxing, but the punching motion in boxing strongly resembles an over-arm throwing action; in low-resolution thermal video the two can look very similar. The prediction captures a dynamic, forceful arm movement that is consistent with boxing, making it a related but less specific interpretation."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Looking around while standing,0.3,"'Looking around while standing' describes a static or very low-motion activity, whereas 'shakehead' is a distinct, dynamic head movement. The prediction neither matches nor is a temporal part of the ground truth action."

videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Picking up an object from the floor,1.0,"The predicted action 'Picking up an object from the floor' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'pickup', differing only in phrasing."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: jumping,0.9,"Jumping is the core motion of jump-roping; the rope itself is often invisible in low-resolution thermal clips, so 'jumping' is effectively a correct description of the activity."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: sweeping the floor,0.9,"'Sweeping the floor' and 'mopping the floor' are semantically very close cleaning activities that differ mainly in the tool used (broom vs. mop). In low-resolution thermal video they are visually almost indistinguishable, so the prediction is effectively equivalent."
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,"'brushhair' involves grooming one's hair with a brush, whereas 'talking on the phone' is a completely unrelated activity. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.0,"Waving is an arm gesture that involves moving the forearm or hand side-to-side, whereas a bicep curl is a weight-lifting motion that flexes and extends the elbow to raise and lower a weight. These are fundamentally different actions with no overlap in purpose or motion pattern, so the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a mobile phone (texting/typing),1.0,The predicted action 'using a mobile phone (texting/typing)' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'playphone'—both describe interacting with a phone.
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.2,"'Drinking' and 'brushteeth' are distinct actions; both involve bringing the hand to the face, but the motions and objects differ. The prediction is not semantically equivalent, nor is it a temporal part of brushing teeth, so it falls in the low-score range."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: Typing on a laptop while seated,1.0,The ground truth label 'type' is perfectly matched by the prediction 'Typing on a laptop while seated'; the action described is exactly the same.

videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Pointing with one arm outstretched,0.2,"'Pointing with one arm outstretched' is a completely different gesture from 'thumbdown'; the former involves extending a finger to indicate direction, while the latter is a distinct downward thumb motion. They are neither semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of the same action."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Showing “two” with fingers (V-sign hand gesture),0.0,"The ground truth is 'makeoksign' (forming an 'OK' gesture with thumb and index finger), while the prediction is a V-sign (two fingers raised). These are distinct, unrelated hand gestures, so the prediction is incorrect."

videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Raising hand,0.0,Raising a hand is not the same as drawing a circle clockwise; the two actions are fundamentally different and unrelated.
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Raising arm,0.2,Raising an arm is a generic motion that does not specifically indicate drawing a circle counter-clockwise; the two actions are only loosely related and the prediction lacks the required circular motion detail.
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"'Waving' is a completely different motion from the ground truth 'stopsign' (a static pose with one arm extended), so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.2,"'Waving' is a distinct arm gesture that does not semantically overlap with 'pullhandin' (pulling hand inward). The two actions are unrelated, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving (hand wave),0.75,"'Push hand away' is a defensive or rejection gesture where the hand moves outward from the body. A 'hand wave' is also an outward hand motion, so the kinematics are very similar; the difference is mainly intent (greeting vs. rejection). Given the abstract nature of the label and the visual similarity, the prediction is strongly related and acceptable."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving hand,1.0,"The predicted action 'waving hand' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'handwave', differing only in wording."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: punching,0.1,"'Punching' is a striking motion with the fists, whereas 'sweep' involves a side-to-side cleaning motion with a broom or similar tool.

videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth 'slide' implies a dynamic sliding motion, whereas the prediction 'standing' is a static pose that does not involve any sliding action or any part of it."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a simple static gesture, whereas 'drawzigzag' implies a continuous, dynamic drawing motion. The two actions are semantically and visually distinct, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Leaning backward while standing,0.85,"Leaning backward while standing is a direct, specific instance of dodging—moving the upper body to avoid something—so it semantically matches the ground truth action 'dodge'."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up an object from the floor,0.3,Picking up an object from the floor is not a recognizable component of bowling; it is a generic action that does not capture the essence of bowling (rolling a ball toward pins).

videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"'Walking' is a controlled, rhythmic gait, whereas 'stagger' implies an unsteady, possibly off-balance movement. They are related locomotion actions but not semantically equivalent, and 'walking' does not capture the unsteadiness inherent in staggering, so the match is weak."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'yawn' are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap; the VLM predicted a completely unrelated activity.
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.4,"Coughing and blowing one’s nose are both respiratory-related actions that can occur during a cold or allergy episode, so they are loosely related. However, they are distinct actions with different motions and purposes, making the prediction only partially correct."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Raising both arms overhead,0.9,"Raising both arms overhead is a direct and common way to stretch oneself, making the prediction semantically equivalent to the ground truth."

videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jumping jack,0.75,"'Jumping jack' is a rhythmic, whole-body movement that clearly falls under the broad category of 'dance'—it is a dynamic, expressive motion rather than a static pose. While not a literal dance style, it is semantically close enough to be considered a valid specific action under the abstract label 'dance'."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jogging in place,1.0,"'Jogging in place' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'jog'; both describe the same running motion, merely specifying that it occurs without forward locomotion."
videos/session_0068_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Lying down on the ground,0.9,"'Lying down on the ground' is the direct result and semantic equivalent of a 'falldown' event; the only difference is that the prediction omits the preceding fall motion, but the final state matches perfectly."

The motions may look superficially similar in a low-resolution thermal clip, yet they describe fundamentally different intents and outcomes, so the prediction is only weakly related."
videos/session_0123_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: talking,1.0,"'Talking' is the core activity that constitutes a 'conversation', making the prediction semantically identical to the ground truth."
videos/session_0124_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sitting down,1.0,"'Sitting down' is the exact motion that leads to the state labeled 'sit', so it is semantically and temporally correct."

videos/session_0128_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Raising both arms above the head,0.7,"Raising both arms above the head is a common dance move, so the predicted action is a specific, valid instance of dancing. However, it is only one component rather than a full dance sequence, hence a medium-high score."
videos/session_0129_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Turning around,0.1,"'Turning around' is a brief, static re-orientation movement, whereas 'jog' is a sustained, rhythmic locomotion exercise. The two actions are semantically and visually unrelated, so the prediction is incorrect."

videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth is a dynamic exercise ('jumpingjack'), while the prediction is a static pose ('standing'). This is a clear mismatch and falls under the low-score category for generic static labels applied to dynamic actions."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: standing still,0.0,"The ground truth is 'squat', a dynamic lower-body exercise. The VLM predicted 'standing still', which is a static pose and not a squat or any part of a squatting motion. Therefore the actions are unrelated."
videos/session_0134_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: kneeling down,0.3,"'Kneeling down' is a distinct motion from a lunge; while both involve lowering the body, they use different postures and muscle groups. The prediction is not a lunge nor a clear temporal part of it, so it receives a low score."
videos/session_0135_turn.mp4,turn,Action: standing,0.2,"The ground truth is 'turn', a dynamic rotational action, while the prediction is the static label 'standing'. These are semantically unrelated; 'standing' is neither a temporal part of turning nor a valid substitute for it."

videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.6,"Waving is a rhythmic arm motion that resembles the arm-swinging aspect of air-drumming, making it related but less specific than the actual action of drumming in the air."
videos/session_0139_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Punching (shadow boxing),1.0,The predicted action 'Punching (shadow boxing)' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'boxing'; shadow boxing is a common form of boxing training.
videos/session_0140_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing still,0.0,"The ground truth 'shakehead' is a dynamic head-movement action, whereas the prediction 'standing still' describes a static pose with no motion. These are completely different and the prediction fails to capture any aspect of the required action."

videos/session_0146_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Jumping in place,0.9,"'Jumping in place' is essentially the same motion as jumping rope minus the rope; the core action (repetitive vertical jumps) is identical, so it is semantically equivalent to 'jumprope'."
videos/session_0147_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,"'Sweeping the floor' is semantically equivalent to 'mopping floor'—both describe cleaning the floor with a tool. The slight difference in tool (broom vs. mop) does not change the core action, so it is treated as an exact match."

videos/session_0167_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Falling down,0.2,"'Falling down' is the opposite of 'dodge'; dodging implies an intentional evasive movement, whereas falling is an uncontrolled collapse. The actions are semantically unrelated and incompatible."
videos/session_0168_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Bowing,0.0,The predicted action 'Bowing' (a gesture of bending the body) is semantically unrelated to the ground truth 'bowling' (the sport of rolling a ball to knock down pins). They are entirely different activities.
videos/session_0169_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving,0.9,'Waving' is essentially the same physical motion as 'lifting up a hand'—raising one hand and moving it—so the predicted action is semantically equivalent to the ground truth.
videos/session_0170_tap.mp4,tap,Action: waving,0.3,"'Waving' and 'tap' are both hand/arm gestures, but they are distinct actions; waving is a broad, repetitive motion while tapping is a short, targeted contact.

There is no semantic or temporal overlap between kicking and passing an item."
videos/session_0503_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Waving (one person waves while the other turns and walks away),0.3,"Waving is a friendly, open-hand gesture, whereas punching is a closed-fist striking motion; they are fundamentally different actions. The VLM’s description does not capture any aspect of a punch or an aggressive motion, so the prediction is only weakly related at best."

videos/session_0890_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Standing,0.1,"'Standing' is a static pose, whereas 'dodge' is a dynamic, evasive movement. The prediction does not capture any aspect of dodging and is essentially the opposite of an active avoidance action."
videos/session_0891_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Picking up an object from the ground,0.3,"Picking something up from the ground is not a recognizable component of bowling; the motions are unrelated, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0892_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Waving (raising one arm),0.9,"'Waving (raising one arm)' is essentially the same physical motion as 'liftupahand'; both describe lifting one arm upward. The slight difference in naming intent (waving vs. simply lifting) is negligible in this low-resolution thermal context, so the prediction is semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0893_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Coughing into elbow,0.0,"'Coughing into elbow' is a respiratory gesture unrelated to the action 'tap', which involves a deliberate hand/finger contact motion."

videos/session_0902_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Talking on the phone,0.3,"'Talking on the phone' is not the same as 'touchface'; while a person might touch their face while on a call, the core action described is different, so only a low similarity score is warranted."
videos/session_0903_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Picking up an object from the ground,0.2,Picking up an object is unrelated to mopping the floor; the two actions serve different purposes and involve distinct motions.
videos/session_0904_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: Scratching head,0.3,"Scratching the head is a different motion from brushing hair; both involve the hand near the head, but the intent and movement patterns are distinct. The prediction is only loosely related and not a valid temporal part of brushing hair."
videos/session_0905_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.0,"Waving is an arm gesture that involves moving the forearm back and forth, whereas a bicep curl is a strength-training exercise that involves flexing and extending the elbow to lift a weight. These are fundamentally different actions with distinct motion patterns and purposes, so the prediction does not match the ground truth."
videos/session_0906_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: texting on a smartphone,1.0,'Texting on a smartphone' is a direct and semantically equivalent instantiation of the ground truth label 'playphone'.
videos/session_0907_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.2,"Drinking and brushing teeth are distinct activities with different hand-to-mouth motions and object interactions; they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or abstract-general pairs. The prediction is therefore largely incorrect."
videos/session_0908_type.mp4,type,Action: Drinking,0.0,"The ground truth label 'type' refers to typing on a keyboard, whereas the predicted action 'drinking' is an entirely different activity with no semantic or contextual overlap."

videos/session_0910_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Giving a thumbs-up gesture,0.2,"The ground truth is 'thumbdown' (a thumbs-down gesture), while the VLM predicted 'giving a thumbs-up gesture'. These are opposite gestures, so the prediction is incorrect and only minimally related."
videos/session_0911_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Smoking,0.0,'Smoking' and 'makeoksign' are semantically unrelated actions; smoking involves inhalation of smoke while making an OK sign is a specific hand gesture.
videos/session_0912_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Pointing with raised arm,0.3,"'Pointing with raised arm' is a different gesture from 'makevictorysign' (typically forming a V-shape with two fingers). While both involve raising an arm, the specific hand configuration and symbolic meaning differ, making the actions only loosely related."
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: hand waving,0.2,"Drawing a circle clockwise is a precise, controlled arm motion, whereas hand waving is a repetitive back-and-forth gesture. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"'Waving' is an arm gesture that involves side-to-side or up-and-down motion, whereas 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' is a specific circular motion in the opposite direction. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct, so the prediction is only weakly related at best."
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand waving,0.0,'Hand waving' is a completely different motion from the ground-truth 'stopsign' (a static pose with arm extended and palm facing out). There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions.
