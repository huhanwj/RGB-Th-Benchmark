videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.2,"The ground truth action 'drawcirclecounterclockwise' involves a specific circular hand or arm movement, while the VLM prediction 'Pointing' describes a different type of hand gesture. The two actions are not semantically equivalent, nor is 'Pointing' a plausible temporal part of 'drawcirclecounterclockwise'. Therefore, the score is low."
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Hand waving,0.2,"The predicted action 'Hand waving' does not semantically match the ground truth action 'stopsign'.
