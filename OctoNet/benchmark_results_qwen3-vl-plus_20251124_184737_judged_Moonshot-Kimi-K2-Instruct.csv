videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: sit,1.0,"The prediction 'sit' exactly matches the ground truth label 'sit', satisfying the highest-scoring criterion of exact match or semantic equivalent."
videos/session_0002_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"'Bending' is semantically equivalent to 'bow'—both describe the same forward-leaning motion of the torso. The wording differs slightly, but the action is the same."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,'Lying down' is the canonical posture for sleeping and is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'sleep' in this context.
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: raise both arms,0.3,"Raising both arms is only a tiny, static component of dancing; it does not convey the rhythmic, whole-body movement implied by 'dance'. The prediction is too generic and insufficient to count as a valid dance action."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Running,1.0,"'Running' is semantically equivalent to 'jog'—both describe the same locomotive action at different intensities, so the prediction is correct."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: fall,1.0,The predicted action 'fall' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'falldown'; both describe the same event of a person falling.
videos/session_0007_jump.mp4,jump,Action: throwing,0.0,'Throwing' and 'jump' are fundamentally different actions; no semantic or temporal overlap exists.
videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jump rope,0.7,"Both 'jumpingjack' and 'jump rope' are vigorous, rhythmic, full-body exercises that involve repeated vertical jumps. While not identical, they are closely related dynamic activities that fit the same high-level category of aerobic exercise, warranting a medium-high score."
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: squat,1.0,The predicted action 'squat' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth 'squat'.
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Step,0.7,"A lunge is essentially a deep forward step with a controlled lowering of the hips, so 'step' captures the core locomotion component. However, 'step' is more generic and does not convey the full lowering motion that distinguishes a lunge from an ordinary step, making it related but less specific."
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The predicted action 'turning' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'turn', differing only in grammatical form."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: crawling,0.2,"'Crawling' and 'pushup' are fundamentally different body movements—crawling involves quadrupedal locomotion, whereas a push-up is an upper-body strength exercise. The actions are neither semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of each other."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Walking,0.0,"'Walking' and 'legraise' are fundamentally different actions—one is ambulatory locomotion, the other is a stationary core/leg exercise. No semantic or temporal overlap exists."
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Waving,0.7,"Air-drumming involves rapid, rhythmic arm and hand motions that strongly resemble waving. While 'waving' is less specific than 'airdrum', it captures the same upper-body movement pattern and is not a generic static label, so it is a related and plausible description."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: adjusting face covering,0.0,"The predicted action 'adjusting face covering' is unrelated to the ground truth 'boxing'; it is a static, non-exercise gesture and does not fall within any boxing-related or general exercise category."
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: looking around,0.4,"'Looking around' involves head movement but is much less specific than 'shakehead'; it could be a slow scan rather than the distinct side-to-side shaking motion implied by the label, so only a weak match."
videos/session_0017_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: making a phone call,1.0,"'Making a phone call' is semantically equivalent to 'answerphone'; both describe the act of using a telephone, so the prediction is correct."
videos/session_0018_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.3,"Drinking is a distinct oral activity that is not the same as eating; while both involve the mouth, they are different actions. The prediction is related but not equivalent, so it falls into the low-score range."
videos/session_0019_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The predicted action 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'drink'.
videos/session_0020_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: covering face,0.85,"'Covering face' is semantically very close to 'wipeface'; both involve bringing a hand to the face region. The predicted action captures the essential motion and intent of wiping or touching the face, making it a near-exact match."
videos/session_0021_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bend,0.75,"'Bend' is a necessary and typical component of the 'pickup' action; while not the full action, it captures the key motion involved in picking something up, making it a strong partial match."
videos/session_0022_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Walking,0.2,"Jump-rope is a distinct, repetitive vertical motion, whereas walking is a horizontal locomotion; they are fundamentally different activities. The prediction is neither semantically equivalent nor a valid temporal part of jump-rope, so it receives a low score."
videos/session_0023_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Sweeping the floor,0.9,'Sweeping the floor' is semantically equivalent to 'mopping floor'—both describe the same cleaning action with only a minor difference in tool (broom vs. mop). The core activity is identical.
videos/session_0024_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,"'brushhair' involves grooming one's hair with a brush, whereas 'talking on the phone' is a completely unrelated communication activity. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions."
videos/session_0025_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Waving,0.0,'Waving' is an arm gesture unrelated to the bicep-curl motion; the two actions are semantically and visually distinct.
videos/session_0026_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using a mobile phone,1.0,The predicted action 'Using a mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of the ground truth 'playphone'.
videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.2,"'Drinking' and 'brushteeth' are distinct activities; bringing a cup to the mouth is not semantically or temporally part of brushing teeth, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: Clapping,0.0,"The ground truth label 'type' refers to typing on a keyboard, while the predicted action 'clapping' is an entirely different gesture with no semantic or contextual overlap."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs up,1.0,The predicted action 'thumbs up' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'thumbup'.
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' and 'thumb-down' are both hand/arm gestures, but they are semantically distinct actions. The VLM did not capture the specific negative-gesture meaning of 'thumb-down' and instead predicted a more generic pointing motion, so the match is weak."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: raise hand,0.3,Raising a hand is a generic gesture that does not specifically indicate making an 'OK' sign; the two actions are only loosely related and the prediction lacks the key finger-circle gesture.
videos/session_0032_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: two-finger gesture,0.9,"'Two-finger gesture' is a clear, specific description of the victory sign (V-sign), making it semantically equivalent to 'makevictorysign'."
videos/session_0033_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: raise right arm,0.0,"Raising the right arm is not a drawing motion, nor does it resemble any part of drawing a circle clockwise; the actions are entirely unrelated."
videos/session_0034_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: raise right arm,0.0,Raising the right arm is a completely different motion from drawing a circle counter-clockwise; the two actions share no semantic or temporal overlap.
videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: Waving,0.0,"'Waving' is a completely different motion from the ground truth 'stopsign' (a static pose with one arm extended), so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,'Waving' is a distinct arm gesture that does not resemble the inward pulling motion implied by 'pullhandin'; the actions are semantically unrelated.
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.7,"'Waving' is a hand/arm motion that resembles the outward pushing motion implied by 'pushhandaway'. While not identical, both involve a forward arm gesture, making the prediction reasonably related and more specific than a generic label."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Waving,1.0,"The predicted action 'waving' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'handwave', differing only in phrasing."
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.2,"Waving is an arm gesture that is semantically and visually distinct from sweeping, which involves a back-and-forth motion typically with a broom or similar tool to clean a surface. The two actions share only a generic 'arm movement' similarity, but the purpose and motion pattern differ, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: raise both arms,0.8,Raising both arms is the primary motion involved in clapping; the VLM captured the essential movement even if it did not explicitly mention the hand contact.
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Coughing,0.0,"'Coughing' is a respiratory action that has no semantic or contextual overlap with 'slide', which involves a gliding or slipping motion. The two actions are entirely unrelated."
videos/session_0042_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing (right hand),0.2,"'Pointing' is a simple directional gesture, whereas 'drawzigzag' implies a continuous, deliberate drawing motion that traces a zig-zag pattern. The two actions differ in both intent and execution, making the prediction largely unrelated to the ground truth."
videos/session_0043_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning,0.2,"'Turning' is a rotational movement, whereas 'dodge' implies a quick lateral or backward motion to avoid something. The two actions are distinct and not semantically equivalent, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0044_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: picking up an object,0.3,"While picking up a bowling ball is part of bowling, the VLM only described a generic ""picking up an object"" without any bowling-specific context. The prediction is too general and does not convey the bowling action, so it falls into the low-score range."
videos/session_0045_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: raise right arm,1.0,'raise right arm' is semantically identical to 'lift up a hand'; both describe the same single-arm lifting motion.
videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Raising hand,0.7,"Raising a hand is a very similar motion to tapping (both involve lifting and moving the arm/hand), but it is not identical. It is a related, plausible movement that could easily be part of a tap gesture, hence a medium-high score."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Waving,0.0,'Waving' is a completely different motion from 'spreadandpinch' (which involves opening and closing the fingers or hands). There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two actions.

videos/session_0103_slide.mp4,slide,Action: reaching with right arm,0.2,"'Reaching with right arm' is a generic arm gesture and does not correspond to the specific action 'slide', which implies a whole-body gliding or sliding motion. The two actions are semantically unrelated."
videos/session_0104_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a simple gesture that does not involve the continuous, directed drawing motion implied by 'drawzigzag'. The actions are semantically unrelated and the prediction is too generic to be considered a valid part of the ground-truth activity."
videos/session_0105_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: turning left,0.3,"'Turning left' is a rotational movement, whereas 'dodge' implies a quick lateral or backward motion to avoid something. The two actions are only loosely related (both involve body movement) but are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal part of the other. Hence the match is weak."
videos/session_0106_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: throwing,0.85,"In bowling, the core motion is the act of throwing the bowling ball toward the pins. The VLM’s prediction 'throwing' captures this essential action, even though it omits the sport-specific context. It is semantically equivalent to the key movement in bowling, so the match is strong."
videos/session_0107_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: raise arm,1.0,'raise arm' is semantically identical to 'lift up a hand'; both describe the same upward motion of an upper limb.
videos/session_0108_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Saluting,0.2,"Saluting is a distinct gesture that involves raising the hand to the forehead, whereas tapping is a quick, light contact motion with the fingers or hand.

videos/session_0137_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Kicking,0.7,"'Kicking' is a leg-raising motion, so it is semantically related to 'legraise', but it is more specific and implies a different intent (striking vs. controlled lifting). Hence it is not an exact match but still a plausible leg-centric action."
videos/session_0138_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: raise hands,0.75,"Raising hands is a key motion involved in air-drumming; while not the full action, it is a specific and relevant component, so the prediction is highly related and acceptable."

videos/session_0548_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Throwing,0.8,"'Throwing' is a core component of boxing (e.g., throwing punches), making it a semantically valid and specific sub-action of the ground truth 'boxing'."
videos/session_0549_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: head turning,0.9,"'Head turning' is essentially the same physical motion as 'shake head'; the only difference is that 'shake head' implies a repeated back-and-forth motion, whereas 'head turning' could be a single turn. Given the low-resolution thermal clip, the VLM captured the core action accurately, so the prediction is treated as semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0550_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: Drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'answerphone' are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap; the VLM predicted a completely unrelated activity.
videos/session_0551_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.4,Drinking is a related ingestion activity but not the same as eating; it is a plausible but less specific interpretation of the ground truth 'eat'.
videos/session_0552_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The predicted action 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'drink'.
videos/session_0553_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Drinking,0.2,"'Drinking' and 'wipeface' are distinct actions—one involves bringing a cup/bottle to the mouth, the other involves rubbing or wiping the face with a hand or cloth. They are not semantically equivalent, nor is drinking a temporal part of wiping the face, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0554_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: Picking up an object,1.0,The predicted action 'Picking up an object' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'pickup'.
videos/session_0555_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: dancing,0.3,"Jump-rope and dancing are distinct activities; while both are rhythmic and involve whole-body motion, they are not semantically equivalent, and dancing is not a temporal part of jump-roping. The prediction is only loosely related and thus warrants a low score."
videos/session_0556_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Swinging an object,0.3,"'Swinging an object' is not semantically equivalent to 'moppingfloor'; swinging motions are not characteristic of mopping, so the actions are largely unrelated."
videos/session_0557_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: touching head,0.75,"'Touching head' is not an exact match for 'brushhair', but in a low-resolution thermal clip the visible motion of repeatedly moving the hand to and across the head is very plausibly interpreted as brushing hair. The prediction captures the key body-part interaction and repetitive motion, making it a strong, though less specific, match."
videos/session_0558_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: adjusting a bag,0.0,"'Adjusting a bag' is an unrelated manipulation task, whereas 'bicepcurl' is a specific strength-training exercise; the two actions share no semantic or functional overlap."

videos/session_0560_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Drinking,0.2,Drinking and brushing teeth are distinct daily activities with different motions and objects; the VLM predicted a completely different action.
videos/session_0561_type.mp4,type,Action: using a mobile phone,0.0,"The ground truth label 'type' refers to the act of typing (e.g., on a keyboard), whereas the predicted action 'using a mobile phone' is a different activity. These are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal part of the other, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0562_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: Thumbs up,1.0,The predicted action 'Thumbs up' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'thumbup'.
videos/session_0563_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: Waving,0.2,"'Waving' and 'thumbdown' are both hand/arm gestures, but they are semantically distinct actions. The prediction is not a temporal part of the ground truth, nor is it a generic label that could encompass the specific gesture. Therefore, the match is weak."
videos/session_0564_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: two-finger hand gesture,0.7,"The predicted 'two-finger hand gesture' is a hand gesture, which is semantically close to the ground truth 'makeoksign' (a specific hand gesture forming an 'O'). However, it is less specific than the exact OK sign, so it falls in the medium range."
videos/session_0565_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: Making a victory (V) sign with the hand,1.0,The predicted action 'Making a victory (V) sign with the hand' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'makevictorysign'.
videos/session_0566_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,"'Waving' is an arm gesture that involves side-to-side or up-and-down motion, whereas 'drawcircleclockwise' is a specific circular motion in one direction. The two actions are visually and semantically distinct, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0567_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: taking a photograph,0.0,The predicted action 'taking a photograph' is entirely unrelated to the ground truth 'drawcirclecounterclockwise'; there is no semantic or temporal overlap between drawing a counter-clockwise circle and photographing.
videos/session_0568_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: raise hand,0.0,"The ground truth 'stopsign' implies a gesture of raising one or both arms to signal a stop, while the prediction 'raise hand' is a generic upward arm motion that could mean waving, asking a question, or stretching. Without evidence that the motion is specifically the stop-sign gesture, the actions are semantically unrelated."
videos/session_0569_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: Waving,0.2,"'Waving' is a distinct arm gesture that does not semantically overlap with 'pullhandin' (pulling hand inward). The two actions are unrelated, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0570_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: waving,0.7,"'Waving' is a hand/arm motion that involves pushing the hand outward and away from the body, which overlaps semantically with the ground-truth action 'pushhandaway'. While not an exact match, the predicted action captures the same general limb movement and intent, making it a related and plausible interpretation."
videos/session_0571_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,"The predicted action 'waving' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'handwave', differing only in minor wording."
videos/session_0572_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: dropping an object,0.1,'Dropping an object' is unrelated to the act of sweeping; it neither describes sweeping nor any preparatory or follow-up motion that would be considered part of sweeping.

videos/session_0576_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Walking,0.0,"'Walking' is a forward, steady motion, whereas 'dodge' is a sudden, evasive movement; they are semantically and visually distinct actions."
videos/session_0577_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: throwing,0.8,"In bowling, the core motion is the act of throwing the ball toward the pins. The VLM’s prediction of 'throwing' captures this essential action, even if it omits the sport-specific context. It is semantically equivalent to the key movement in bowling, so it receives a high score."
videos/session_0578_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Pointing,0.8,'Pointing' is a specific instance of lifting up a hand; the predicted action is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'liftupahand'.

videos/session_0583_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Head raise,0.0,'Head raise' is not semantically related to 'cough'; raising the head is a different motion and does not encompass or imply coughing.
videos/session_0584_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: turning,0.2,"'Turning' is a rotational movement, whereas 'stagger' implies an unsteady, swaying or stumbling motion; they are fundamentally different actions with no temporal overlap or semantic equivalence."

videos/session_0586_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: coughing,0.2,"'Coughing' and 'blowing nose' are both respiratory-related actions, but they are distinct and easily separable; the VLM predicted a completely different action rather than a temporal part or a semantically close variant."
videos/session_0587_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Spreading arms,0.9,"'Spreading arms' is a direct, specific instance of stretching oneself, hence semantically equivalent to the ground truth."
videos/session_0588_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: drinking,0.0,"'drinking' involves bringing a cup or bottle to the mouth, whereas 'touchface' involves contact between hand and face; the two actions are distinct and unrelated."

videos/session_0591_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: shoulder touch,0.85,"'shoulder touch' is a direct, specific instance of 'pushsomeone'—a gentle push/touch on the shoulder—so the predicted action semantically matches the ground truth."
videos/session_0592_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Kicking,1.0,The predicted action 'Kicking' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'kicksomeone'—both describe the act of kicking. The slight difference in phrasing does not change the core action.
videos/session_0593_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: pointing,0.2,"Pointing is a completely different motion from punching; the arm gesture and intent differ significantly, so the prediction is not semantically or temporally related to the ground truth action."
videos/session_0594_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Walking away,0.2,"'Walking away' is a movement that departs from the scene, whereas 'conversation' implies staying in place and interacting.

videos/session_0931_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: Walking,0.3,"'Walking' is a controlled, steady gait, whereas 'stagger' implies an unsteady, possibly off-balance movement. They are related but fundamentally different actions, so the prediction is only weakly relevant."
videos/session_0932_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'yawn' are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap; the VLM predicted a completely unrelated activity.
videos/session_0933_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Cover mouth,0.75,"Covering the mouth is an integral part of blowing one’s nose (to contain the sneeze or blow), so the predicted action is a temporally valid component of the ground-truth action."
videos/session_0934_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Stretching,1.0,The predicted action 'Stretching' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'stretchoneself'.
videos/session_0935_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Drinking,0.2,"'Drinking' involves bringing a hand (and usually an object) to the mouth, whereas 'touchface' is specifically about touching the face itself. The two actions are distinct and not semantically equivalent, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0936_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,The predicted action 'handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth label 'handshake'.
videos/session_0937_hug.mp4,hug,Action: Hugging,1.0,"The predicted action 'Hugging' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'hug', differing only in grammatical form."
videos/session_0938_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: touch face,0.0,"'touch face' is a self-directed action, whereas 'pushsomeone' is an interpersonal, forceful action directed at another person; they are semantically unrelated."
videos/session_0939_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: step,0.2,'step' is a generic locomotion action and does not convey the aggressive or targeted nature implied by 'kicksomeone'. The two actions are semantically distant.
videos/session_0940_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Push,0.7,"'Push' is a closely related upper-body motion to 'punch', but it is less specific and lacks the aggressive intent implied by 'punchsomeone'. It is plausible but not an exact or semantically equivalent match."
videos/session_0941_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: walking,0.2,"'Walking' is a locomotion action, whereas 'conversation' is an interactive, stationary activity. The two are semantically unrelated and the prediction does not capture any aspect of the ground truth."
videos/session_0942_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Sit down,1.0,The prediction 'Sit down' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'sit' and represents the same action.
videos/session_0943_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Walking,1.0,The predicted action 'Walking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'walk'.
videos/session_0944_bow.mp4,bow,Action: Bending,0.9,"'Bending' is semantically equivalent to 'bow'—both describe the act of lowering the upper body. The wording differs slightly, but the core action is the same."
videos/session_0945_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying down,0.9,"'Lying down' is the exact posture that constitutes sleeping; the only difference is the absence of the sleep state itself, which cannot be verified from a short thermal clip. Thus the prediction is semantically equivalent to the ground truth."
videos/session_0946_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Walking,0.2,"Walking and dancing are distinct locomotor activities; walking is not a temporal part of dancing, nor is it semantically equivalent. The prediction is therefore largely incorrect."
videos/session_0947_jog.mp4,jog,Action: drinking,0.0,'Drinking' is an entirely different activity from 'jog'; there is no semantic or temporal overlap.
videos/session_0948_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: falling,1.0,'falling' is a direct semantic equivalent of 'falldown'; both describe the same action.
videos/session_0949_jump.mp4,jump,Action: drinking,0.0,"The predicted action 'drinking' is unrelated to the ground truth 'jump'; drinking is a static or seated activity, whereas jumping is a dynamic vertical motion."
videos/session_0950_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: raise both arms,0.8,Raising both arms is the defining motion of a jumping jack; the VLM captured the core action even if it did not name the full exercise.
videos/session_0951_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Squatting,1.0,The prediction 'Squatting' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'squat'.
videos/session_0952_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Lunge,1.0,The predicted action 'Lunge' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'lunge'.
videos/session_0953_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Turning around,1.0,The predicted action 'Turning around' is a direct and semantically equivalent match for the ground truth 'turn'.
videos/session_0954_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: kneeling,0.1,'Kneeling' is a static posture and bears no resemblance to the dynamic exercise 'pushup'; the two actions are fundamentally different.
videos/session_0955_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Running,0.1,'Running' and 'legraise' are fundamentally different exercises; running is a locomotion activity while legraise is a stationary core/leg exercise. They share no semantic overlap and are not temporally related.
videos/session_0956_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping hands,0.7,"Air-drumming and clapping both involve rhythmic, repetitive arm and hand motions in front of the torso. While not identical, the visual signature is similar enough in a low-resolution thermal clip to be considered a related, less-specific match."
videos/session_0957_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: waving,0.3,"Waving is a generic arm gesture that is only loosely related to boxing; it lacks the specific punching motions and combat context of boxing, making it a weak match."
videos/session_0958_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: looking up and down,0.7,"'Looking up and down' is a head-movement action that overlaps with the essence of 'shakehead' (moving the head), but it is less specific and does not explicitly describe the side-to-side shaking motion. It is related and plausible, yet not an exact or semantically equivalent match."
videos/session_0959_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'answering the phone' are entirely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap.
videos/session_0960_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.4,Drinking is related to eating (both are ingestive actions) but is not the same activity; it is a plausible but less specific alternative within the same context.
videos/session_0961_drink.mp4,drink,Action: Drinking,1.0,The predicted action 'Drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'drink'.
videos/session_0962_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: drinking,0.0,"'Drinking' and 'wipeface' are entirely different actions—one involves bringing a cup/bottle to the mouth, the other involves wiping the face with a hand or cloth. No temporal overlap or semantic similarity exists."
videos/session_0963_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: picking up an object,1.0,"The predicted action 'picking up an object' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'pickup', differing only in phrasing."
videos/session_0964_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: waving,0.2,"Waving is a completely different motion from jumping rope; the two actions involve distinct body movements and energy levels, so the prediction is not semantically or temporally related to the ground truth."
videos/session_0965_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: handshake,1.0,The predicted action 'handshake' is an exact match to the ground truth label 'handshake'.
videos/session_0966_hug.mp4,hug,Action: kissing,0.0,'kissing' and 'hug' are distinct interpersonal actions; they are neither semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of each other.

videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: Bowing,0.0,"'Bowing' is a courteous gesture that involves bending the torso, whereas 'kicksomeone' is an aggressive striking motion with the leg. The two actions are semantically and kinetically unrelated, so the prediction is completely incorrect."
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: Punching,1.0,The predicted action 'Punching' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'punchsomeone'; both describe the same physical motion.
videos/session_0970_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: Handshake,0.6,"A handshake is a social interaction that can occur during a conversation, making it related but more specific than the broad label 'conversation'. It is not an exact match, yet it is a plausible component of the ground-truth activity."
videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: dancing,0.8,"Dancing is a dynamic, exercise-like movement that falls within the broad 'gym' category, so it is a correct specific action for the abstract label."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: waving,0.7,"'Waving' is a dynamic arm movement that qualifies as a light exercise or active motion, fitting within the broad 'gym' label. While not a typical gym exercise, it is still a valid, active movement under the abstract 'gym' category, warranting a medium-high score."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: bending down,0.9,"'Bending down' is a clear, dynamic body movement that falls within the open-ended scope of 'freestyle', so it is a valid specific action for the abstract label."
videos/session_0974_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Dancing,0.8,"Dancing is a specific, dynamic exercise activity that falls under the broad 'gym' label, so it is considered a correct match."
videos/session_0975_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Walking,0.9,"'Walking' is a specific, active movement that falls within the broad scope of 'freestyle' (do whatever action desired), so it is semantically correct."
