videos/session_0132_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Standing,0.1,"The ground truth is the dynamic exercise 'jumpingjack', while the prediction is the static label 'standing'. This is a clear mismatch and falls under the low-score category for generic static labels applied to dynamic actions."
videos/session_0133_squat.mp4,squat,Action: Standing,0.2,"The ground truth is 'squat', a dynamic lower-body exercise. The VLM predicted 'standing', which is a static posture and not a squat or any part of a squat motion. Therefore the prediction is largely incorrect."

The prediction is related only at the coarse level of 'hand gesture' and misses the specific negative connotation of the ground truth, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0155_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Raise arm,0.3,Raising an arm is a generic motion that does not specifically indicate the formation of an 'OK' sign; it is only a partial or preparatory movement and lacks the distinctive gesture required.
videos/session_0156_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' and 'make victory sign' are distinct hand gestures; the former uses an extended index finger while the latter forms a V-shape with two fingers.

videos/session_0508_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: saluting,0.7,"Saluting and hand-waving are both arm-raising gestures performed near the head, making them visually and semantically similar. While not identical, the motion is close enough to be considered a related action rather than a mismatch."
videos/session_0509_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: raising arm,0.2,"Sweeping involves a repetitive arm motion that may include raising the arm, but simply 'raising arm' is far too generic and does not capture the sweeping motion or intent; it is only weakly related and lacks the necessary specificity."
videos/session_0510_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Coughing,0.0,'Coughing' and 'clap' are entirely different actions—one is a respiratory reflex and the other is a deliberate hand gesture. No semantic or temporal overlap exists.

The VLM did not recognize the specific victory-sign gesture and instead predicted a different, more generic pointing motion, so the match is poor."
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: Pointing,0.1,'Pointing' is a static gesture that does not involve the circular arm motion required by 'drawcircleclockwise'; the two actions are semantically unrelated.
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.0,'Pointing' is a completely different motion from drawing a circle counter-clockwise; no semantic or temporal overlap exists.
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth 'stopsign' implies a static pose with the arm extended like a stop sign, whereas 'waving' is a dynamic back-and-forth motion of the arm. These are distinct actions with no semantic overlap."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: waving,0.2,"'Pullhandin' implies pulling the hand inward toward the body, whereas 'waving' is an outward, repetitive motion. The two actions are fundamentally different and not semantically related."
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Pointing,0.3,"'Pointing' is a different gesture from 'pushhandaway' (a defensive pushing motion). While both involve arm movement, they are not semantically equivalent, nor is pointing a temporal part of pushing away. The actions are distinct enough to warrant a low score."
videos/session_0918_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: raise arms,0.9,"Raising arms is the core motion of a handwave; the VLM simply described the movement more generically, so it is semantically equivalent."
videos/session_0919_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: raising hand,0.1,Raising a hand is not semantically related to sweeping; the two actions are entirely different and unrelated.
videos/session_0920_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Clapping,1.0,The predicted action 'Clapping' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'clap'.
videos/session_0921_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Pointing,0.0,'Pointing' is a static gesture and bears no resemblance to the dynamic action 'slide' (sliding across a surface). The two actions are semantically unrelated and visually distinct.
videos/session_0922_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: pointing upwards,0.2,"'Pointing upwards' is a simple arm gesture, whereas 'drawzigzag' implies a continuous, deliberate drawing motion in a zig-zag pattern. The two actions are fundamentally different and the prediction does not capture the essence of the ground truth."
videos/session_0923_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Standing,0.0,"'Standing' is a static pose, whereas 'dodge' is a dynamic, evasive movement. The two actions are semantically unrelated, and a generic static label does not satisfy a clearly dynamic ground-truth action."
videos/session_0924_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throwing,0.8,Throwing is the core motion in bowling; the VLM captured the essential action even if it did not name the sport.
videos/session_0925_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: raise arm,1.0,'raise arm' is semantically identical to 'lift up a hand'; both describe the same physical motion.
videos/session_0926_tap.mp4,tap,Action: pointing,0.7,"'Pointing' and 'tap' are both fine-motor hand gestures performed with an extended finger; they are closely related but not identical. The prediction is specific and active, so it receives a medium-high score rather than a low one."
videos/session_0927_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Arm raising,0.2,"'Arm raising' is a single, simple motion, whereas 'spreadandpinch' implies a two-phase gesture (spreading fingers apart then pinching them together). The predicted action does not capture the pinch component and is therefore only loosely related, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0928_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a very different motion from 'drawing a triangle'; it lacks the continuous drawing gesture and the triangular trajectory, so the actions are not semantically equivalent or temporally related."
videos/session_0929_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: bending forward,0.3,"Bending forward is only loosely related to sneezing; it could be part of many actions. It is not semantically equivalent nor a clear temporal component of sneezing, so the match is weak."
videos/session_0930_cough.mp4,cough,Action: sneezing,0.7,"Coughing and sneezing are both brief, involuntary respiratory reflexes that look very similar in a low-resolution thermal clip. While not identical, they are closely related actions, so the prediction is reasonably accurate."
videos/session_0931_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: bending forward,0.3,"'Bending forward' is a controlled posture, whereas 'stagger' implies an unsteady, involuntary loss of balance. The actions are semantically and visually distinct, so the prediction is only weakly related."
videos/session_0932_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: scratching head,0.0,Scratching the head is a completely different action from yawning; there is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two.
videos/session_0933_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: eating,0.0,'eating' and 'blownose' are completely unrelated actions; no semantic or temporal overlap exists.
videos/session_0934_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: Arms Raised,0.9,"Raising arms is a common and direct way to stretch oneself, so the predicted action is semantically equivalent to the ground truth."
videos/session_0935_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Smoking,0.0,"'Smoking' involves a repetitive hand-to-mouth motion with an object, whereas 'touchface' is a brief contact between hand and face without any implied object or habitual motion. The two actions are semantically unrelated, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0936_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: Handshake,1.0,The predicted action 'Handshake' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'handshake'.
videos/session_0937_hug.mp4,hug,Action: hug,1.0,The predicted action 'hug' is an exact match to the ground truth label 'hug'.
videos/session_0938_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Touching the face,0.0,"'Touching the face' is a self-directed action, whereas 'pushsomeone' explicitly involves applying force to another person. The two actions are semantically unrelated and describe entirely different interactions."
videos/session_0939_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: walking,0.0,"'walking' is a completely different motion from 'kicksomeone'; there is no kicking or aggressive action implied in walking, so the prediction fails to capture any aspect of the ground truth."
videos/session_0940_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: punch,0.9,"The predicted action 'punch' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'punchsomeone'; the only difference is the omission of the object 'someone', which does not change the core action."
videos/session_0941_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: walking around,0.2,"'Walking around' is a locomotion action, whereas 'conversation' is a stationary, interactive activity. The two are semantically unrelated and the prediction does not capture any aspect of conversing."

videos/session_0943_walk.mp4,walk,Action: walking,1.0,The predicted action 'walking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'walk'.
videos/session_0944_bow.mp4,bow,Action: bending over,1.0,'Bending over' is semantically identical to 'bow'—both describe the same forward-leaning motion of the torso.
videos/session_0945_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Standing,0.0,"'Standing' is the opposite of 'sleep'; the person is upright and awake rather than lying down and resting, so the actions are completely different."
videos/session_0946_dance.mp4,dance,Action: walking,0.2,"Walking and dancing are distinct locomotor activities; walking is not a temporal part of dancing, nor is it semantically equivalent. The prediction is therefore largely incorrect."
videos/session_0947_jog.mp4,jog,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth 'jog' is a dynamic running-like activity, whereas the prediction 'standing' is a static pose. These are semantically unrelated, and 'standing' is not a valid temporal part of jogging."
videos/session_0948_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sitting,0.0,"'Sitting' is a stable, static posture, whereas 'falldown' is a sudden, uncontrolled transition to the ground. The two actions are semantically and visually distinct; sitting does not encompass any part of a fall."
videos/session_0949_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Clapping,0.0,"Clapping is a distinct, stationary upper-body action that does not involve the vertical propulsion characteristic of jumping; the two actions are semantically and kinetically unrelated."
videos/session_0950_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: pull-up,0.0,'pull-up' and 'jumpingjack' are two distinct exercises with no overlap in motion or intent; the prediction is completely different from the ground truth.
videos/session_0951_squat.mp4,squat,Action: squat,1.0,The predicted action 'squat' is an exact semantic match to the ground truth 'squat'.
videos/session_0952_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: Walking,0.2,'Walking' and 'lunge' are fundamentally different movements; walking is locomotion while a lunge is a specific strength-training exercise. The prediction does not match the ground truth in any semantic or temporal sense.
videos/session_0953_turn.mp4,turn,Action: turning,1.0,"The predicted action 'turning' is a direct semantic match for the ground truth 'turn', differing only in grammatical form (gerund vs. base verb)."
videos/session_0954_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: Bending over,0.7,"""Bending over"" is a key posture during a push-up (the lowering phase), so it is closely related to the ground-truth action. However, it is less specific than ""push-up"" itself, hence a medium-high score."
videos/session_0955_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: Running,0.0,'Running' and 'legraise' are fundamentally different exercises; running is a locomotion activity while legraise is a stationary core/leg exercise. No semantic or temporal overlap exists.
videos/session_0956_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.7,"Clapping is a rhythmic arm/hand motion that closely resembles the arm-swinging motion of air-drumming; both are percussive upper-body activities. While not identical, the prediction captures the essential dynamic nature of the ground-truth action."
videos/session_0957_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: pointing,0.2,"Pointing is a static gesture and bears no resemblance to the dynamic, combat-oriented action of boxing; the two actions are semantically and visually unrelated."
videos/session_0958_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: standing,0.0,"'Standing' is a static pose, whereas 'shakehead' is an active, dynamic motion. The prediction does not capture any part of the head-shaking action and is therefore completely mismatched."
videos/session_0959_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: making a phone call,1.0,'Making a phone call' is semantically equivalent to 'answerphone'; both describe the act of engaging in a phone conversation.
videos/session_0960_eat.mp4,eat,Action: Drinking,0.3,"Drinking is a distinct oral activity from eating; while both involve the mouth, they are not semantically equivalent nor is drinking a temporal part of eating. The actions are related but fundamentally different, warranting a low score."
videos/session_0961_drink.mp4,drink,Action: drinking,1.0,The predicted action 'drinking' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'drink'.
videos/session_0962_wipeface.mp4,wipeface,Action: Phone call,0.0,'Phone call' is a completely different action from 'wipeface'; there is no semantic or temporal overlap.
videos/session_0963_pickup.mp4,pickup,Action: bending,0.85,Bending is an integral and necessary motion when performing a pickup action; the VLM correctly identified the key body movement involved in picking something up.
videos/session_0964_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: running in place,0.8,"Running in place is a rhythmic, repetitive, cardio exercise that closely resembles the motion and purpose of jumping rope; both are high-intensity, on-the-spot activities often used for aerobic conditioning. While not identical, the predicted action is semantically and functionally very similar to the ground truth 'jumprope', warranting a high score."

videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking,0.8,"Walking is a common gym activity (e.g., treadmill walking), so it falls within the broad 'gym' category. While not as specific as 'lifting weights' or 'running', it is still a valid exercise-related action."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a single, static gesture that does not resemble any typical gym exercise or active movement. It is neither a specific exercise nor a plausible component of a gym routine, so it falls far short of the abstract 'gym' label."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: bending down,0.9,"'Bending down' is a clear, dynamic body movement that falls within the open-ended scope of 'freestyle', satisfying the requirement that any specific active movement is correct for this label."
videos/session_0974_gym.mp4,gym,Action: walking,0.8,"Walking is a common gym activity (e.g., treadmill walking), so it falls within the broad 'gym' category."
videos/session_0975_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: walking,0.9,"The ground truth 'freestyle' allows any action the subject chooses; 'walking' is a specific, valid action under this umbrella, so the prediction is essentially correct."
