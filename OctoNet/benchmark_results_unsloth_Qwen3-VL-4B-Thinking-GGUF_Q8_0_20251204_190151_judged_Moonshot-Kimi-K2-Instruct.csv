videos/session_0892_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: pointing,0.75,"'Pointing' is a specific arm-raising action that falls under the umbrella of 'liftupahand'; it is not an exact match but is semantically close and clearly involves lifting a hand, so it is rated as a strong partial match."
videos/session_0893_tap.mp4,tap,Action: saluting,0.2,"'Saluting' is a distinct gesture involving raising a hand to the forehead, whereas 'tap' typically involves a quick light contact or striking motion with the hand or finger. The two actions are semantically unrelated and not temporally connected, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0894_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.0,'Waving' is a completely different arm motion from 'spreadandpinch' (a two-hand gesture involving spreading fingers and then pinching). There is no semantic or temporal overlap.
videos/session_0895_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a very different motion from drawing a triangle; it lacks the continuous path and shape-making required by 'drawtriangle', so it is only minimally related."
videos/session_0896_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'sneeze' are entirely different bodily actions with no semantic or temporal overlap; the prediction is completely unrelated to the ground truth.
videos/session_0897_cough.mp4,cough,Action: drinking,0.0,'drinking' and 'cough' are entirely different actions with no temporal overlap or semantic similarity; one is an ingestion motion while the other is an involuntary respiratory reflex.
videos/session_0898_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: bending over,0.4,"'Bending over' is a bodily movement that could occur during a stagger, but it is not itself a stagger; the actions are related yet distinct, so it receives a medium-low score."

videos/session_0910_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' and 'thumbdown' are both hand gestures but describe distinctly different motions; they are neither semantically equivalent nor is one a temporal part of the other, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0911_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Drinking,0.0,"'Drinking' and 'makeoksign' are entirely different actions with no semantic overlap; the former involves bringing a cup or bottle to the mouth, while the latter is a specific hand gesture forming an 'OK' sign."
videos/session_0912_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: using a mobile device,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'makevictorysign', which involves a very specific hand gesture. The predicted action 'using a mobile device' is a completely different activity with no overlap in gesture or intent, hence a low score."
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: waving,0.2,'Waving' is an arm gesture that is fundamentally different from the circular drawing motion implied by 'drawcircleclockwise'; no clear semantic or motion overlap exists.
videos/session_0914_drawcirclecounterclockwise.mp4,drawcirclecounterclockwise,Action: pointing,0.1,Pointing and drawing a circle counter-clockwise are fundamentally different arm/hand motions; one is a static directional gesture while the other is a continuous circular movement. The prediction is neither a temporal part nor a semantically related variant of the ground truth action.
videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: waving,0.0,"The ground truth 'stopsign' implies the person is performing a gesture resembling a traffic stop sign (arm held out horizontally), while the predicted action 'waving' is a different arm gesture (typically arm moving side-to-side). These are distinct motions with no semantic overlap, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: taking a selfie,0.1,"'Taking a selfie' involves holding a phone or camera up toward the face, while 'pullhandin' implies pulling something toward the body or inward motion of the hand. These are semantically and visually distinct actions with no clear overlap."
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a distinct gesture that does not involve pushing or repelling an object or person away, so it does not semantically overlap with 'pushhandaway'."
videos/session_0918_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: raising arm,0.9,"'Raising arm' is essentially the core motion of a handwave; the only difference is the lack of an explicit waving gesture, but the predicted action captures the same limb movement and is semantically very close to 'handwave'."
videos/session_0919_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.25,"Waving and sweeping are distinct arm motions—waving is a side-to-side greeting gesture, whereas sweeping involves a pushing/pulling motion to move debris. They are neither semantically equivalent nor plausible temporal parts of each other, so the prediction is largely incorrect."

videos/session_0954_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: lying down,0.7,"A push-up begins and ends in a prone, lying-down position. The model only saw a single low-resolution frame and output 'lying down', which is the static starting/ending pose of a push-up. While it did not capture the dynamic pressing motion, the pose is directly relevant and not a generic static label for a clearly dynamic action. Thus it is related but less specific, warranting a medium-high score."
videos/session_0955_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: dance,0.2,"The ground truth is 'legraise', a specific exercise movement, whereas the prediction 'dance' is a different rhythmic activity that does not overlap with leg-raising motions. They are unrelated actions."
videos/session_0956_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.75,"Air-drumming involves rapid, rhythmic arm and hand motions that are visually very similar to enthusiastic clapping. In a low-resolution thermal clip, the two actions are nearly indistinguishable, so 'clapping' is a semantically close and plausible interpretation of the observed motion."
