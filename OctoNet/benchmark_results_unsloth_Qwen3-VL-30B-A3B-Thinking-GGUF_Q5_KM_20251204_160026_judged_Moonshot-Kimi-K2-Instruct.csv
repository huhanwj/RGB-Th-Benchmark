videos/session_0001_sit.mp4,sit,Action: Squat,0.8,"A squat is a transitional movement that involves lowering the body toward a seated position; it is semantically and temporally close to the act of sitting, hence counted as a valid partial action under the 'sit' label."
videos/session_0002_walk.mp4,walk,Action: Bending down to adjust footwear,0.2,"The prediction describes a stationary, crouched action (bending down to adjust footwear) while the ground truth is the dynamic action 'walk'. These are fundamentally different activities."
videos/session_0003_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: lying down,0.9,'lying down' is the canonical posture for sleeping; it is semantically equivalent to the 'sleep' label in this thermal clip context.
videos/session_0004_dance.mp4,dance,Action: jump,0.3,"Jumping is a distinct, discrete action and not semantically equivalent to dancing; while both are dynamic, they differ in form and intent, so only a low partial match is warranted."
videos/session_0005_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Walking,0.7,"'Walking' is closely related to 'jog'—both are rhythmic ambulatory motions, just differing in intensity. The VLM captured the correct class of locomotion but failed to recognize the higher-intensity jogging motion, making it a related but less specific prediction."
videos/session_0006_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: Falling,1.0,The prediction 'Falling' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'falldown'; both describe the same action of a person collapsing to the ground.

videos/session_0008_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: Jump Rope,0.7,Jump rope and jumping jacks are both vigorous, rhythmic, full-body cardio exercises that involve coordinated arm and leg movements. While not identical, they are semantically close and fall within the same exercise category, warranting a medium-high score.
videos/session_0009_squat.mp4,squat,Action: squat punch,0.9,"The predicted action 'squat punch' explicitly contains the ground truth action 'squat' and adds an extra motion 'punch'. Since 'squat' is clearly present and correctly identified, the prediction is nearly exact with only an additional minor component, warranting a high score."
videos/session_0010_lunge.mp4,lunge,Action: walking,0.0,'Walking' is a distinct locomotion action and does not overlap with the specific lower-body exercise 'lunge'; the two movements are fundamentally different.
videos/session_0011_turn.mp4,turn,Action: Walking,0.2,"The ground truth is 'turn' (a rotation or pivot motion), while the prediction is 'walking' (forward locomotion). These are fundamentally different actions with no clear temporal overlap or semantic equivalence."
videos/session_0012_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending,0.75,"'Bending' accurately captures the core body motion of a push-up (lowering and raising the torso), making it a closely related, valid description of the exercise even though it is not the exact label."
videos/session_0013_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: walking,0.0,'legraise' is a specific leg-lifting exercise while 'walking' is a locomotion activity; they are fundamentally different movements and neither is a temporal part of the other.
videos/session_0014_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: waving,0.75,"Air-drumming is a rhythmic arm motion that closely resembles waving; the predicted action captures the same upper-body movement pattern, making it a strong semantic match despite the wording difference."
videos/session_0015_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: speaking,0.0,'Speaking' is an entirely different activity from 'boxing'; there is no semantic overlap or temporal relation between talking and performing boxing movements.
videos/session_0016_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: head turn,0.85,'Head turn' is essentially the same physical motion as 'shake head'; both involve rotating the head side-to-side. The predicted action captures the core movement of the ground-truth label.

videos/session_0027_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: Speaking into a microphone,0.0,"The ground truth action is 'brushteeth', which involves a specific repetitive hand-to-mouth motion with a toothbrush. The VLM predicted 'speaking into a microphone', which is an entirely different action involving vocalization and a handheld device held near the mouth. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between brushing teeth and speaking into a microphone."
videos/session_0028_type.mp4,type,Action: using a device,0.75,"The ground truth 'type' implies keyboard typing, which is a specific instance of 'using a device'. While the VLM's wording is broader (could be phone, tablet, etc.), it correctly captures the interactive nature of the action and is semantically close."
videos/session_0029_thumbup.mp4,thumbup,Action: thumbs-up,1.0,"The predicted action 'thumbs-up' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth label 'thumbup', differing only in hyphenation and capitalization."
videos/session_0030_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' and 'thumb-down' are distinct hand gestures; they are not semantically equivalent nor is one a temporal part of the other, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0031_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: Peace sign,0.3,"The predicted action 'peace sign' is a distinct hand gesture that does not match the ground truth 'makeoksign'. While both involve hand gestures, they are semantically different and not temporally or categorically related."

videos/session_0035_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: taking a selfie,0.0,The ground truth 'stopsign' implies the person is making a stop-sign gesture (raising a flat hand). The predicted action 'taking a selfie' involves holding a phone and pressing a button—completely unrelated to the stop-sign gesture.
videos/session_0036_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a different arm gesture from 'pullhandin' (pulling hand inward). The motions are not semantically equivalent, nor is one a temporal part of the other."
videos/session_0037_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: Waving,0.6,"'Waving' is a hand/arm gesture that resembles the outward pushing motion implied by 'pushhandaway', but it is less specific and does not clearly convey the defensive/repelling intent of pushing something away."
videos/session_0038_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: waving,1.0,The predicted action 'waving' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'handwave'.
videos/session_0039_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.15,"Waving and sweeping are fundamentally different arm motions—waving is a friendly greeting gesture while sweeping involves a pushing/pulling motion to move debris. The two actions share little semantic or kinematic overlap, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0040_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Dancing,0.3,"The predicted action 'dancing' is a distinct, rhythmic whole-body activity, whereas the ground truth 'clap' is a brief, upper-body gesture. They are not semantically equivalent, nor is clapping a typical sub-action of dancing. Hence the match is weak."
videos/session_0041_slide.mp4,slide,Action: standing,0.0,"The ground truth 'slide' implies a dynamic sliding motion, whereas the prediction 'standing' is a static posture that does not overlap with or temporally precede a slide. Hence, it is a complete mismatch."

videos/session_0046_tap.mp4,tap,Action: raising arm,0.7,"'Raising arm' is a plausible component of a tapping motion—one often lifts an arm to reach and tap something—so it is related and partially correct, though not a full description of 'tap'."
videos/session_0047_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.2,"'Waving' is a completely different arm gesture from 'spreadandpinch' (which involves opening and closing fingers as if stretching or pinching). The two actions share no meaningful semantic overlap, so the prediction is incorrect."

videos/session_0051_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.3,"'Walking' is a normal, controlled gait, whereas 'stagger' implies an unsteady, possibly impaired motion. The two are related but not semantically equivalent, and the VLM's prediction misses the key unsteadiness that defines 'stagger'."
videos/session_0052_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: drinking,0.0,'Drinking' and 'yawning' are completely different actions with no semantic or temporal overlap; one involves ingesting liquid while the other is an involuntary reflex of opening the mouth wide due to tiredness.
videos/session_0053_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Coughing,0.4,"Both coughing and blowing one’s nose are respiratory-related actions involving the face and upper body, so they are somewhat related. However, they are distinct activities—coughing is a reflexive expulsion of air, while blowing the nose is a deliberate clearing of nasal passages. The prediction is therefore only loosely related and lacks specificity."
videos/session_0054_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: jumping,0.0,"'stretchoneself' involves slow, controlled movements to elongate muscles, whereas 'jumping' is a rapid, ballistic motion. The two actions are fundamentally different in nature and purpose, so the prediction is completely off."
videos/session_0055_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: talking on the phone,0.3,"'Talking on the phone' involves raising the hand to the ear, which may include touching the face, but it is a distinct, more specific action than the generic label 'touchface'. The prediction is only loosely related and not semantically equivalent or a clear temporal part of the ground truth."

videos/session_0058_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Handshake,0.3,"'Handshake' and 'push someone' are both social interactions involving physical contact, but they are semantically and kinetically distinct actions; the predicted label does not describe pushing or any clear aggressive contact, so the match is weak at best."
videos/session_0059_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kick,0.9,"'kick' is the core action described by the ground truth 'kicksomeone'; the predicted action captures the exact physical motion, differing only in the lack of the object 'someone'. This is a near-exact semantic match."
videos/session_0060_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' and 'punching someone' are fundamentally different actions—one is a benign gesture, the other a hostile physical attack. The VLM's prediction is neither semantically related nor a plausible misinterpretation of the aggressive motion, so it receives a low score."

videos/session_0065_sleep.mp4,sleep,Action: Lying on back,0.9,'Lying on back' is the canonical posture for sleeping; the prediction is semantically equivalent to the ground truth action 'sleep'.
videos/session_0066_dance.mp4,dance,Action: Arm raising,0.7,"'Arm raising' is a common, recognizable dance movement, so it falls within the broad scope of 'dance'. However, it is only one component rather than a full dance routine, making it related but less specific."
videos/session_0067_jog.mp4,jog,Action: Jumping rope,0.6,"Both jogging and jumping rope are rhythmic, aerobic, lower-body-intensive exercises. The predicted action is not jogging, but it is a closely related cardio exercise that fits the general spirit of the label 'jog'."
videos/session_0068_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: lying down,0.9,'Lying down' is the immediate result of a 'falldown' event; the actions are semantically equivalent in this context.
videos/session_0069_jump.mp4,jump,Action: Jumping rope,0.9,"The ground truth 'jump' is a broad vertical motion; 'jumping rope' is a specific instance of jumping. The VLM correctly identifies the core action (jump) while adding extra detail (rope), which is acceptable under the high-score criteria."
videos/session_0070_jumpingjack.mp4,jumpingjack,Action: jump rope,0.7,"Both 'jumpingjack' and 'jump rope' are vigorous, rhythmic, full-body exercises involving repeated vertical jumps. While not identical, they share the key motion of jumping and are semantically close within the exercise domain, warranting a medium-high score."

videos/session_0074_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending over,0.4,"""Bending over"" could occur during the downward phase of a push-up, but it is far less specific than ""pushup"" and could equally describe unrelated actions. It is only loosely related to the ground truth."
videos/session_0075_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: kicking,0.75,"Leg raises involve lifting the legs upward, which visually resembles a kicking motion. The VLM's 'kicking' is a related dynamic action that captures the same leg-lifting movement, so it is semantically close enough to be considered correct for the high-level label 'legraise'."
videos/session_0076_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: Clapping,0.6,"Clapping is a rhythmic arm/hand motion that shares the same body region and repetitive nature as air-drumming, making it a related but less specific action; it is not an exact match but falls within the same broad category of upper-body rhythmic movements."
videos/session_0077_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: Boxing,1.0,The predicted action 'Boxing' is an exact semantic match for the ground truth 'boxing'.
videos/session_0078_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: Standing,0.0,"'Standing' is a static posture, whereas 'shakehead' is an active head-movement action. The prediction does not describe any part of shaking the head and is therefore completely mismatched."

videos/session_0089_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: drinking,0.2,"Drinking and brushing teeth are distinct actions with different hand-to-face motions and object interactions; they are not semantically equivalent, temporally related, or abstractly overlapping. The prediction is therefore incorrect."
videos/session_0090_type.mp4,type,Action: sitting,0.0,"The ground truth label 'type' implies the person is engaged in typing on a keyboard or similar device. The VLM predicted 'sitting', which describes only a static posture and is not the activity itself.

videos/session_0100_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: Head scratching,0.2,"'Head scratching' and 'handwave' are both hand-to-head motions, but they describe distinctly different actions. Head scratching is a self-grooming or thinking gesture, whereas a handwave is an intentional greeting or signaling motion. The semantic gap is too wide for even a medium score, so it falls into the low range."
videos/session_0101_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: Waving,0.2,'Waving' is an arm gesture that does not involve the sweeping motion of a broom or hand across a surface; the actions are semantically and visually unrelated.
videos/session_0102_clap.mp4,clap,Action: Gesturing,0.75,"'Gesturing' is a broader category that clearly encompasses the specific action 'clap'; clapping is a type of gesture. While not an exact match, the prediction captures the essence of the action."

A handshake is a greeting gesture, whereas pushing someone is an aggressive or defensive act. The VLM has identified an interaction, but it is not the correct type, so only a low partial-credit score is warranted."
videos/session_0121_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kicking,1.0,The prediction 'kicking' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'kicksomeone'—both describe the act of kicking; the extra object 'someone' does not change the core action.

videos/session_0890_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: Walking,0.1,"'Walking' is a steady forward locomotion, whereas 'dodge' is a sudden evasive movement; they are semantically and visually distinct, so the prediction does not match the ground truth."
videos/session_0891_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: Throwing,0.9,"Throwing is the central motion in bowling (the ball release phase), making it a semantically correct and temporally valid part of the bowling action."
videos/session_0892_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: Pointing,0.9,"'Pointing' is a direct and specific instance of lifting up a hand, making the prediction semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'liftupahand'."
videos/session_0893_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Checking wristwatch,0.85,"'Checking wristwatch' is essentially a wrist-tapping motion directed at a watch, which is a direct, semantically equivalent instance of the ground-truth action 'tap'."
videos/session_0894_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: waving,0.2,"'Waving' is a hand-gesture action, whereas 'spreadandpinch' involves opening and closing the fingers in a pinching motion; the two actions are visually and semantically distinct, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0895_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: Pointing,0.1,"'Pointing' is a fundamentally different gesture from 'drawtriangle'—the latter involves drawing a triangular shape, while the former is merely indicating direction. No semantic or temporal overlap exists."
videos/session_0896_sneeze.mp4,sneeze,Action: drinking,0.0,"'Drinking' and 'sneeze' are semantically unrelated actions; neither is a temporal part of the other, nor do they share any meaningful similarity."
videos/session_0897_cough.mp4,cough,Action: Eating,0.0,"'Eating' and 'cough' are unrelated actions; coughing is a brief respiratory reflex, while eating involves deliberate hand-to-mouth movements. They are neither semantically equivalent nor temporally related."
videos/session_0898_stagger.mp4,stagger,Action: walking,0.4,"'Walking' is a controlled, rhythmic motion, whereas 'stagger' implies an unsteady, possibly off-balance gait. They are related (both involve locomotion on foot) but the prediction is too generic and does not capture the unsteadiness of staggering, so it falls into the medium-low range."
videos/session_0899_yawn.mp4,yawn,Action: Drinking,0.0,Drinking and yawning are entirely different actions; there is no semantic or temporal overlap between them.
videos/session_0900_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Smoking,0.0,Smoking and blowing one’s nose are entirely different actions with no semantic overlap; the VLM predicted a completely unrelated activity.
videos/session_0901_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: pull-up,0.2,"'Pull-up' is a strength-training exercise that involves pulling the body upward, whereas 'stretchoneself' refers to a stretching motion to extend muscles. The two actions are fundamentally different in purpose and mechanics, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0902_touchface.mp4,touchface,Action: Eating,0.3,"'Eating' involves bringing food to the mouth, which is a distinct action from simply touching one's face. While both may involve hand-to-face contact, the semantic intent and typical motion patterns differ, making the prediction only weakly related."
videos/session_0903_moppingfloor.mp4,moppingfloor,Action: Golf swing,0.0,A golf swing is an entirely unrelated action to mopping the floor; there is no semantic or contextual overlap between swinging a golf club and cleaning a floor with a mop.
videos/session_0904_brushhair.mp4,brushhair,Action: adjusting sunglasses,0.0,Adjusting sunglasses is unrelated to brushing hair; no plausible overlap or temporal connection exists.
videos/session_0905_bicepcurl.mp4,bicepcurl,Action: Adjusting a hat,0.0,'Adjusting a hat' is an unrelated upper-body gesture that bears no resemblance to the strength-training exercise 'bicepcurl'; the two actions are semantically and visually distinct.
videos/session_0906_playphone.mp4,playphone,Action: Using mobile phone,1.0,'Using mobile phone' is a direct semantic equivalent of 'playphone'; both describe the same action of interacting with a phone.
videos/session_0907_brushteeth.mp4,brushteeth,Action: smoking,0.0,'Smoking' and 'brushing teeth' are completely different activities with no semantic overlap; the predicted action does not match the ground truth in any reasonable interpretation.
videos/session_0908_type.mp4,type,Action: making a phone call,0.1,"The ground truth label 'type' refers to keyboard typing, whereas 'making a phone call' is a distinctly different activity involving holding a phone to the ear and speaking, not typing."

videos/session_0910_thumbdown.mp4,thumbdown,Action: checking a watch,0.0,"The ground truth 'thumbdown' is a specific hand gesture, whereas 'checking a watch' is a completely different action involving looking at the wrist for time; there is no semantic or temporal overlap."
videos/session_0911_makeoksign.mp4,makeoksign,Action: touching face,0.4,"Touching the face is not the same as forming an 'OK' sign with the fingers, but both involve hand-to-face contact, making it loosely related yet clearly less specific."
videos/session_0912_makevictorysign.mp4,makevictorysign,Action: pointing,0.15,"'Pointing' and 'makevictorysign' are fundamentally different hand gestures; the former involves extending a single finger, whereas the latter forms a V-shape with two fingers. They are neither semantically equivalent nor temporally related parts of the same action."
videos/session_0913_drawcircleclockwise.mp4,drawcircleclockwise,Action: reaching up,0.0,"'Reaching up' is an upward arm motion, whereas 'drawcircleclockwise' requires a continuous circular arm/hand movement in the clockwise direction; the actions are fundamentally different."

videos/session_0915_stopsign.mp4,stopsign,Action: wave,0.0,"The ground truth 'stopsign' refers to the action of making the stop-sign gesture (raising a hand with palm facing outward). The predicted action 'wave' is a different gesture (typically a side-to-side hand motion used for greeting). They are visually and semantically distinct actions, so the prediction is incorrect."
videos/session_0916_pullhandin.mp4,pullhandin,Action: stop gesture,0.0,"'stop gesture' is a hand signal indicating cessation, whereas 'pullhandin' describes an inward pulling motion of the hand/arm; the two actions are semantically unrelated and visually distinct."
videos/session_0917_pushhandaway.mp4,pushhandaway,Action: taking a picture,0.0,'Taking a picture' is a completely different action from 'pushhandaway' (a pushing gesture). There is no semantic or temporal overlap between the two.
videos/session_0918_handwave.mp4,handwave,Action: pull-up,0.0,"'Pull-up' and 'handwave' are entirely different actions—one is an upper-body strength exercise, the other a simple arm gesture—so they share no semantic overlap."
videos/session_0919_sweep.mp4,sweep,Action: waving,0.25,"Waving and sweeping are fundamentally different arm motions—waving is a greeting gesture while sweeping involves pushing a broom across the floor. They are neither semantically equivalent nor related in a way that would justify a medium score, so the prediction is largely incorrect."
videos/session_0920_clap.mp4,clap,Action: talking on the phone,0.0,The predicted action 'talking on the phone' is entirely unrelated to the ground truth 'clap'. There is no semantic or temporal overlap between these two actions.
videos/session_0921_slide.mp4,slide,Action: Pointing,0.1,"'Pointing' and 'slide' describe fundamentally different motions—one is a static gesture, the other a dynamic movement across a surface—so they are not semantically or temporally related."
videos/session_0922_drawzigzag.mp4,drawzigzag,Action: Pointing,0.2,"'Pointing' is a simple, static gesture and does not involve the continuous, dynamic arm motion required to draw a zigzag pattern, making it largely unrelated to the ground truth action."
videos/session_0923_dodge.mp4,dodge,Action: standing,0.2,"'Standing' is a static pose and does not capture the dynamic, evasive nature implied by 'dodge'. The prediction is too generic and unrelated to the expected action."
videos/session_0924_bowling.mp4,bowling,Action: throwing,0.85,"In bowling, the primary motion is the act of throwing the bowling ball down the lane. The predicted action 'throwing' directly captures this core component of bowling, making it semantically equivalent for this context."
videos/session_0925_liftupahand.mp4,liftupahand,Action: reaching up,0.9,'Reaching up' is essentially the same physical motion as 'lifting up a hand'—raising an arm upward—so the prediction is semantically equivalent to the ground truth action.
videos/session_0926_tap.mp4,tap,Action: Arm raising,0.3,"'Arm raising' is a broad, generic motion that does not capture the specific, fine-grained action of 'tap'. While both involve arm movement, tapping is a brief, targeted contact gesture, whereas raising an arm is a larger, preparatory motion. The actions are too dissimilar to be considered a match."
videos/session_0927_spreadandpinch.mp4,spreadandpinch,Action: Pointing,0.0,"""Pointing"" is a single-finger gesture, whereas ""spreadandpinch"" involves opening the fingers wide (spread) and then bringing thumb and fingers together (pinch). These are fundamentally different hand actions with no overlap in semantics or motion."
videos/session_0928_drawtriangle.mp4,drawtriangle,Action: pointing,0.2,'Pointing' is a distinct hand gesture and not semantically or temporally related to the act of drawing a triangle; it is therefore considered a completely different action.

videos/session_0933_blownose.mp4,blownose,Action: Covering face,0.7,"'Covering face' is not an exact match for 'blownose', but it is a closely related and necessary part of blowing one’s nose (people usually cover their face with a tissue or hand). It captures the key motion without naming the full action, so it earns a medium-high score."
videos/session_0934_stretchoneself.mp4,stretchoneself,Action: putting on a mask,0.0,The predicted action 'putting on a mask' is entirely unrelated to the ground truth 'stretchoneself'; there is no semantic or temporal overlap between stretching one's body and donning a mask.

videos/session_0938_pushsomeone.mp4,pushsomeone,Action: Shoulder touch,0.85,'Shoulder touch' is a direct and specific instance of 'pushsomeone'—it involves making physical contact to apply a small pushing force on another person. The semantics match closely even though the wording differs.
videos/session_0939_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kicking,0.95,"The prediction 'kicking' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'kicksomeone'—both describe the same physical action of kicking. The extra 'someone' in the GT only specifies the target but does not change the core action, so the match is nearly exact."
videos/session_0940_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: shoulder tap,0.2,"""Shoulder tap"" is a light, non-aggressive contact gesture, whereas ""punch someone"" is a forceful, aggressive striking action. The two are semantically and kinetically distinct; the prediction does not match the intent or motion of the ground truth."
videos/session_0941_conversation.mp4,conversation,Action: walking towards each other,0.6,"The prediction describes two people moving toward one another, which is a plausible prelude to a conversation, but it does not yet capture the interactive, communicative aspect implied by 'conversation'.

videos/session_0947_jog.mp4,jog,Action: walking,0.7,"'Walking' is a closely related, lower-intensity form of locomotion compared to 'jogging'. While not an exact match, it falls within the same family of rhythmic ambulatory movements and is therefore a reasonable but less specific interpretation."
videos/session_0948_falldown.mp4,falldown,Action: sitting,0.2,"'Sitting' is a stable, static posture, whereas 'falldown' is a sudden, dynamic event. The two actions are semantically and visually distinct; predicting sitting does not capture any part of a fall."

videos/session_0954_pushup.mp4,pushup,Action: bending over,0.25,"'Bending over' is a very weak match for 'pushup'; it only describes a partial posture without capturing the core push-up motion. It is too generic and not a specific exercise, so it falls into the low-score range."
videos/session_0955_legraise.mp4,legraise,Action: marching,0.3,'Marching' is a distinct leg movement (alternating high knee lifts while walking in place) and does not overlap with 'legraise' (lifting one or both legs straight out while stationary). The actions are different enough to fall into the low-score category.
videos/session_0956_airdrum.mp4,airdrum,Action: gesturing,0.75,"'Gesturing' captures the arm and hand movements that are central to air-drumming, so it is semantically close to the ground truth action even though it is less specific."
videos/session_0957_boxing.mp4,boxing,Action: wave,0.25,"The predicted action 'wave' is a simple arm gesture, whereas 'boxing' involves rapid, forceful punching motions. While both use the arms, 'wave' does not capture the intensity or specificity of boxing and is more of a static or social gesture, making the match very weak."
videos/session_0958_shakehead.mp4,shakehead,Action: standing,0.1,'Standing' is a static pose and does not semantically overlap with the dynamic action 'shakehead'; they are completely different.
videos/session_0959_answerphone.mp4,answerphone,Action: using mobile phone,1.0,The ground truth 'answerphone' inherently involves using a mobile phone; the predicted action 'using mobile phone' is semantically equivalent and thus correct.

videos/session_0964_jumprope.mp4,jumprope,Action: Dancing,0.3,"Dancing and jumprope are distinct rhythmic activities; while both are dynamic, they involve different body motions and equipment (rope vs none). The prediction is not a temporal part of jumprope, nor is it a specific exercise that falls under the jumprope label. Thus, the actions are only weakly related."
videos/session_0965_handshake.mp4,handshake,Action: shaking hands,1.0,"The prediction 'shaking hands' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'handshake', describing the same interpersonal greeting action."

videos/session_0968_kicksomeone.mp4,kicksomeone,Action: kicking,1.0,The predicted action 'kicking' is semantically identical to the ground truth 'kicksomeone'; the latter merely adds the implied object of the kick.
videos/session_0969_punchsomeone.mp4,punchsomeone,Action: slap,0.85,"Both 'punchsomeone' and 'slap' are aggressive striking actions directed at another person; the difference is only in the specific striking style. Semantically they are very close, so the prediction is considered correct."

videos/session_0971_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Walking,0.75,"Walking is a common gym activity (e.g., treadmill walking), so it falls within the broad 'gym' category. It is a specific, dynamic exercise, not a generic static posture, and therefore counts as a correct interpretation of the abstract label."
videos/session_0972_gym.mp4,gym,Action: Stretching,0.9,"Stretching is a common and specific exercise activity that clearly falls under the broad 'gym' label, so the prediction is semantically correct and highly relevant."
videos/session_0973_freestyle.mp4,freestyle,Action: Bending Down,0.9,"'Bending Down' is a specific, dynamic movement that clearly falls within the broad scope of 'freestyle' (do whatever action desired), so the prediction is semantically correct."
